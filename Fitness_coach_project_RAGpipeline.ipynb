International Board Certified Lactation Consultants  (IBCLCs) are health-care professionals (often a registered nurse or  registered dietitian) certified in breastfeeding management that  work with new mothers to solve problems and educate families  about the benefits of this practice. Research shows that  breastfeeding rates are higher among women who had infants in  hospitals that make IBCLCs available to new mothers, rather than  those who gave birth in institutions without these professionals on  staff.3  Other important practices for maternity hospitals to support  breastfeeding are summarized in the Ten Steps to Successful  Breastfeeding, launched jointly by the WHO and UNICEF.4 These  recommended  practices\\xa0  include:  helping  mothers  initiate  breastfeeding within one hour of birth; keeping mothers and babies  together (rooming in); encouraging breastfeeding on demand, and  giving breastfed infants no food or drink other than breastmilk,  unless medically indicated.  In addition, spouses, partners, and other family members can  play critical roles in helping a pregnant woman make the decision  to breastfeed and assisting with feeding after the baby is born.  3.\\xa0US Department of Health and Human Services.

              "  'text': 'Osteoporosis is a debilitating disease that markedly increases the  risks of suffering from bone fractures. A fracture in the hip causes  the most serious consequences—and approximately 20 percent of  senior citizens who have one will die in the year after the injury.  Osteoporosis affects more women than men, but men are also at  risk for developing osteoporosis, especially after the age of seventy.  These  statistics  may  appear  grim,  but  many  organizations—including the National Osteoporosis Foundation and  the OSG—are disseminating information to the public and to health- care professionals on ways to prevent the disease, while at the same  time, science is advancing in the prevention and treatment of this  disease.10  As  previously  discussed,  bones  grow  and  mineralize  predominantly during infancy, childhood, and puberty. During this  time, bone growth exceeds bone loss. By age twenty, bone growth is  fairly complete and only a small amount (about 10 percent) of bone  mass accumulates in the third decade of life. By age thirty, bone  mass is at its greatest in both men and women and then gradually  declines after age forty. Bone mass refers to the total weight of  bone tissue in the human body. The greatest quantity of bone tissue  a person develops during his or her lifetime is called peak bone  mass. The decline in bone mass after age forty occurs because bone  loss is greater than bone growth. The increased bone degradation  decreases the mineral content of bone tissue leading to a decrease  in bone strength and increased fracture risk.  Osteoporosis is referred to as a silent disease, much like high  blood pressure, because symptoms are rarely exhibited.

These include:   \\u2022 \\tGovernments at all levels, including the agencies working  with governments.

The results of a blood test give the  concentrations of substances in a person\\u2019s blood and display the  normal ranges for a certain population group. Many factors, such as  physical activity level, diet, alcohol intake, and medicine intake can  influence a person\\u2019s blood-test levels and cause them to fall outside  the normal range, so results of blood tests outside the \\u201cnormal\\u201d  range are not always indicative of health problems. The assessment  of multiple blood parameters aids in the diagnosis of disease risk  and is indicative of overall health status. See Table 2.2 \\u201cBlood Tests\\u201d  for a partial list of substances measured in a typical blood test. This  table notes only a few of the things that their levels tell us about  health.

              "  'text': 'Foreword Many factors like, physical, psychological, socio-economic  and cultural influence our health, both in our day-to-day life  and in the long run. Health of children is very important as  they constitute a large percentage of our population. In this  endeavour, school education plays an important role. Right to  Education Act 2009 has very categorically focused on the role  of school in holistic development and health of children in the  age group  of 6-14 years. Therefore, health and physical fitness  needs to be looked into at different levels of schooling.  Health  and Physical Education (including Yoga) is an integral part of the  school curriculum, towards an overall development of the child.   With this view, the National Council of Educational Research  and Training (NCERT) is in the process of developing textbooks  on Health and Physical Education for Classes IX and X. The present textbook – Health and Physical Education for Class  IX, focuses on a holistic understanding of health highlighting  importance of exercise, games and sports, nutrition and the  environment. This book also provides a scope to discuss the  psycho-social and mental health related issues of children and  collective responsibilities for healthy community living. Given  the interdisciplinary nature of this subject, cross references  have also been mentioned.  Given the inter-related nature of the concepts covered in the  area of Health and Physical Education, the presentation is made  in a cohesive and integrated manner, rather adopting fragmentary  approach. Experiential learning activities for acquiring skills for  healthy living are made an integral part of the book. NCERT appreciates the hard work done by the Textbook  Development Committee. I am highly thankful to Professor  Saroj Yadav, Dean (Academic) and Project Coordinator of  National Population Education Project (NPEP) and Adolescence  Education Programme (AEP) for her continuous effort to develop  this material in the present form. Several experts and teachers  contributed towards the finalisation of this book. We are grateful  to them and their institutions.  pre pages.indd   3 18-11-2016   4:25:29 PM'},\n",

Good health can be  maintained by eating the right kind of food, living in a healthy environment  and undertaking physical activities throughout life. This textbook is,  therefore, of more importance for the growing young students.  But then,  how can both teachers and students make the best use of this book? As a teacher you have to understand that this textbook is different  from other subject textbooks in the sense that its contents need to be  understood well and applied throughout life for one’s own well being and  that of others. Its use should not, therefore, be solely examination driven.  Even a general discussion from time to time would be useful. Activities  included in it, are of practical nature and enjoyable and you can make  sure that concepts are clarified by involving students in experiential  learning. Physical activities and exercises of all kinds have been given to  ensure the development of fitness and questioning skills, including life  skills. You as a student can undertake activities, play games and do yoga as  given in the book in a relaxed manner for healthy living.  The textbook  also contains abundant interesting case studies related to your age and  concerns.  Thought provoking incidents have been included at relevant  places. Think and answer questions related to various dimensions of  health and physical education have been added.  We would welcome your feedback on this book in terms of — How  did you like this textbook?

              "  'text': 'Health and Diseases 1 1.1 \\t Introduction We  normally  relate  the  terms  diseases  and  illness  interchangeably in relation to health, even though these  words do not mean the same. Health is the general condition  of a person in respect to all aspects of life. It is also a level  of functional and/or metabolic efficiency of an organism. The  word metabolic is the adjective of the term metabolism which  means the whole range of big chemical processes that occur  within us or any living organism to produce energy and basic  materials needed for important life processes. Diseases and  illness adversely affect these processes. And thus health,  diseases and illness are inter-related. However,   health is not  just being free from diseases, illness or injury.  As defined  by World Health Organisation (WHO), health is “a state of  complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely  an absence of disease or infirmity”.  1.2 \\t What is Illness? Let’s now see how is illness different from that of disease?  While illness and disease are at times used interchangeably,  these in fact, are different from each other. Disease refers to a  biomedically defined deviation from norms of body function or  structure, whereas, illness is the experience of this deviation.  It is a state of experience by the body when one or more of  the control systems of the body are not functioning normally.  Illness refers to a subjective distress  feeling of a person, when  one is sick or suffering from some disease.  However, it is not  appropriate to conclude that any one being merely free from  illness or disease is healthy. You might have seen people suffering from various types of  diseases. Some of the diseases, like high blood pressure affect  only a particular person who is suffering from it. On the other  hand, some diseases like common cold, spread rapidly and  affect a number of people in a very short period. You must  have often wondered as to how does this happen. In one of the  chapters of your textbook on Science, you would have studied  about ‘Why We Fall Ill’. In that chapter, it is mentioned how  diseases are caused and how some of these affect only the  persons who suffer from them are called non-communicable,  whereas, there are those diseases that are transmitted from one  Chapter-1 Health & diseases.indd   1 08-11-2016   11:04:47 AM'},\n",

The chapter  also mentions how communicable and non-communicable  diseases can be prevented and controlled.  1.3 \\t Communicable Diseases  Let us understand how communicable diseases are spread. These  diseases are caused by certain infectious agents which may be  bacteria or viruses. These are capable of being transmitted from  person to person or from the environment to person. 1.3.1\\t Classification   Communicable diseases can be classified on the basis of the  causative organisms. These are as follow: •  Bacterial: Typhoid, Cholera, Tuberculosis •  Viral: Common cold, Influenza, HIV infection, Dengue •  Protozoal: Malaria, Kala azar •  Fungal: Fungal infections of nails, groins, skin, hair •  Parasitic: Infestations of intestinal worms, like round   worm, or lice. Modes of transmission: The modes of transmission can be  classified as direct and indirect transmission.  (a) Direct transmission As we have studied in our earlier classes, direct transmission  of diseases takes place as follows: Direct contact or touching: When we touch a person or  come in direct contact with the skin or mucous membrane of  the diseased person, it transmits infections like skin and eye  infection. Droplet infection:  Spray of droplets of saliva or secretion  of a diseased person spreads common cold, tuberculosis,  meningitis. Contact with soil: Can cause acquiring the disease agent  directly and may spread diseases like: hookworm infestation  and tetanus. Inoculation into skin or mucosa: Certain diseases  spread in other ways. For example, Rabies is spread to  humans from animal. It is generally known that it occurs due  to a dog or a monkey bite. Hepatitis occurs owing to virus,  transmitted through contaminated needles. The HIV (Human  Immunodeficiency Virus) can be transmitted by sexual contact  or through transmission of infected blood from an infected  person. HIV can be transmitted by the HIV infected mother  to baby and can cause AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency  Syndrome).

              "  'text': 'Health and Diseases\\t 3 (b) Indirect transmission Communicable diseases are also transmitted indirectly in  the following ways that are popularly known as ‘5Fs’— flies,  fingers, fomites (material capable of carrying infections, like  towels, handkarchiefs etc.), food and fluid.   Some diseases are spread through water, food, ice, blood  and body tissues and organs. For example, typhoid, diarrhoea,  polio, intestinal parasites and infective hepatitis. Flies  contaminate food and other eatables. A living carrier (also known as a vector) is a disease  agent that lives on or inside the body of the carrier causing  diseases like malaria and plague. Airborne infectious materials  transmitted through droplet infection or dust cause diseases  like respiratory infections and itch mites. Fomites are objects  like towels, handkerchiefs, toys, glass, spoons, etc. which we  use daily. Eye and skin infections and dysentery (diarrhoea  with blood) are spread through these fomites. Our unclean  hands and fingers act as disease causing agents and transfer  infection to food through skin, nose, and causes diseases, such  as intestinal parasites, dysentery, typhoid.  Healthy people can also spread disease if they are “carriers”.  These are the people who themselves may be immune to the  organisms they harbour, but can be a source of transmission  to others as happens in the case of typhoid.   1.3.2\\t Prevention  and  Control  of  Communicable Diseases The following measures help in prevention and control the  spread of communicable diseases: Personal hygiene •  Bathing everyday and clean clothes keep our body free  from harmful microbes. •  Cutting nails and washing hair regularly. •  Brushing teeth twice a day (morning and night)  particularly after meals.  •  Ensuring that your ears are clean.  •  Do not share articles that are of personal use, that is,  towels, soaps, tooth brushes, combs, razors and other  toiletries.  •  Wash hands before touching food or water and before  eating or drinking. •  Wash hands with soap and water before touching your  face, eyes and mouth and also before and after using  the toilet.  •  Many microbes like virus, bacteria and fungi are  transmitted by touching surfaces with hands and  Activity 1.2 • List how many  things you follow  for food and  water hygiene  • Discuss the list  with your friend. • What would  you like to do  to improve your  personal hygiene.

Hence by washing hands, we  can prevent diseases like diarrhoea, flu, skin and eye  infections. Food and water hygiene •  Drink potable water. If it does not appear clean, boil or  filter and then consume it.  •  Eat only freshly prepared food or consume it within four  hours of preparation.  •  Do not purchase and consume fruits and vegetables  which have been cut and kept in the open for a long  time.  •  Keep all food articles covered to prevent contamination  by flies. Environmental sanitation •  Use sanitary latrines; avoid open air defecation.  •  Throw waste in dustbins to avoid breeding of flies.  •  Clean the drains regularly. •  Regularly check the places where water is collected  and has the possibilities of mosquito breeding. Spray  insecticide to prevent breeding of mosquitoes.  •  Try to prevent contamination of drinking water (source of  water should be away from source of garbage collection/ waste disposal site). The container of drinking water  must be kept at a clean and safe place. Vaccines  Vaccines boost immunity and thus helps the body fight diseases.  A large number of infectious diseases can be prevented by  taking vaccines at an appropriate time, such as, diphtheria,  pertussis, polio, tetanus, rabies, measles, chickenpox, typhoid,  etc. Treatment of diseases using medicines  Medicines kill microbes and /or slow their growth. These are  classified as anti-virals, anti-fungals, anti-protozoals and  antibiotics according to the group of microbes they act upon.  However, these medicines should be taken in the recommended  dose and duration as advised by the doctor. One should avoid  self-medication. Isolation of patients with communicable diseases Patients suffering from such diseases that are communicable  should be kept in a clean environment isolated from others. Education and awareness It is important to make people aware about communicable  diseases, their causes and modes of spread.  People should  Activity 1.3 Have a round of your  school.

When these are caused by an unhealthy  lifestyle, these diseases are also called lifestyle diseases.  Risk factors of non–communicable diseases include lack of  physical exercises, poor dietary habits, inadequate sleep,  stress and habits like smoking, taking alcohol and tobacco  chewing. An arbitrary classification of non–communicable diseases  can be: Lifestyle diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart  diseases, stroke and cancer. Mental health diseases like depression; and trauma. Given below are the behavioural risk factors which can  give way to manifestation of the physiological risk factors  and ultimately lead to the diseases.   1.4.1\\t High Blood Pressure or Hypertension  Dietary factors   All packaged and canned food items contain a very high level  of sodium because of the presence of salt that is used as a  preservative. If you are in the habit of adding table salt to your  food you are consuming excess salt. Use of excess salt is linked  with hypertension. Hence, consumption of excessive salt in  daily food, packaged and canned foods need to be avoided.  Sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise   You can put on excess weight, if you do not exercise daily. This  excess weight and lack of exercise can lead to hypertension.  Behavioural Risk  Factors Physiological Risk  Factors Disease   Outcomes • Unhealthy Diet • Physical Inactivity • Tobacco Use • Alcohol Use • Stress • Blood Pressure • Blood Glucose • Cholesterol • Weight Loss • Heart Disease • Stroke • Diabetes • Cancer Source: National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke, A Guide  for Health Workers, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, GOI, New Delhi.

Mental stress and chronic anxiety   People who cannot manage stress and constantly worry about  things, are prone to hypertension. Hence, one needs to learn to  cope with stress in a healthy way by doing meditation and yoga  and diverting attention by observing healthy mental habits like  listening to music, reading, writing poems, pursuing a hobby, etc.  Tobacco use  Intake of nicotine either through smoking or chewing tobacco  may lead to hypertension and should be avoided. Consistent  use of tobacco, gutkha, khaini, etc. has been linked to various  types of cancer. The consumption of tabacco, therefore, must  be avoided.  Endocrine Diseases Diabetes mellitus is one of the endocrine diseases.  It is caused  due to inadequate secretion of the hormone insulin from  pancreas. Insulin regulates the level of sugar in our body.  Lack  of insulin causes increase of sugar in our body leading to the  condition called diabetes mellitus. Common symptoms of this  are increase in hunger, frequency of urination, and growing  thirst. Until recently, most children and adolescents with diabetes  were thought to have Type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes.  However, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM Type 2) among children  is now being increasingly reported from several parts of the  world. Adolescents who are obese are more likely to get Type 2  diabetes which is manifested as high blood sugar. If untreated,  it leads to complications in kidneys, eyes and other organs  systems in the body. Diabetes can be managed primarily by  bringing about changes in lifestyle and physical exercises and  medication.  Hereditary Disorders  Genetic disorders such as hemophilia, thallasemia, muscular  dystrophy are hereditary diseases which run through  generations in a family. Constant care and support may help  the concerned individual manage these disorders.  1.4.2\\t  Prevention and Cure  In India, non–communicable diseases cause major health  problems. These diseases cause disability, loss of income,  disruptions in family environment and poor quality of life in  the most productive years. We are going to have the highest  incidence of diabetes in the world by 2020.

However, efforts should  be made to prevent them. We can prevent  these, if we adopt a healthy lifestyle right  from childhood and continue it throughout  life. Non–\\xadcommunicable diseases can be  prevented in the following ways: Healthy diet Eating a balanced diet helps in the prevention  of obesity and other lifestyle diseases. The  balanced diet includes fruits and vegetables,  preferably locally available and seasonal,  wholegrain products (including pulses), milk  and milk products.  Adequate sleep  We all require daily 6–8 hours of sound sleep. Inadequate sleep  leads to changes in blood pressure, increase in stress level and  disturbance of what is called the biological clock. Regular exercise  People who undertake physical exercise and yoga activites  daily keep themselves physically fit, feel happy and do not put  on excess weight.  One must do 20–30 minutes of physical activity daily to  keep fit. This can be done by taking part in sports. Exercising  or spot jogging can be done at home. Simple walking, climbing  stairs, not using the lift and skipping have the same effect.  Gym is another dedicated place for workouts.

Meditation, relaxation, exercises and other yoga actvities help  reduce stress. You can also engage in hobbies like drawing,  painting, listening to music and so on as relaxation techniques  when under any type of stress. All these have positive impact  that reduce anxiety and depression and prevent diabetes,  hypertension and heart attacks in the long run.  Avoiding the use of tobacco, alcohol and drugs  Use of tobacco, both by way of smoking and consuming  chewable tobacco in any form directly contributes to heart  disease, stroke, chronic lung disease and common cancers.  Even the non–smokers inhale the smoke released by smokers  around them. Therefore, prohibition of smoking in public places  is an example of a public health regulation that decreases the  risk for non–smokers. You should request the smokers not to  smoke in public places. You may avoid company of smokers. Alcohol use contributes to chronic liver disease, depression  and injuries, especially motor vehicular injuries. Both alcohol  and drugs can have long term effects not only on the physical  health but also on the mental health.  Excess stimulants like caffeine in tea, coffee and cola drinks  also have a harmful effect on our body as they cause rapid  increase in heart-beat rate, lack of sleep and elevated blood  pressure.  These may also cause acidity and stomach ulcers.  Addictive drugs impair social and occupational functioning  and are associated with impaired mental health.   Antioxidants Antioxidants help in prevention of the damage, repair of cellular  functions and delay in the ageing process. Fresh vegetables,  fruits and dry fruits are rich sources of antioxidants. Use of Ayurvedic, Homeopathy and Unani medicine also  help in the cures of Non-communicable Diseases. Ayurveda is the science of life and health, developed in India  since ages. It lays emphasis on prevention and promotion of  health in addition to curing the diseases. The treatment under  Ayurveda can be successfully used in early stages of diabetes,  liver-disorders, skin diseases, stress, insomnia (sleeplessness)  and anorectal-diseases. Some specialised Ayurvedic treatments  can be helpful in diseases like joint-pains, neuromuscular  diseases and paralysis.

The Unani  medicines are given to the person suffering from a disease to  promote an equilibrium of these elements in the body. 1.5\\t Reproductive Health You have read in your previous classes that cell is the structural  and functional unit of our body. To perform various specialised  functions, nature has divided our body into many functional  units or systems comprising different organs. One such system  is the ‘reproductive system’. It is made up of reproductive and  genital organs. You will study more about the structure and  functions of the reproductive system in your science classes.  In this chapter you will learn about the need to keep it healthy.  In fact, reproductive health refers to healthy reproductive  organs performing normal functions. But there are diseases  that adversely affect this system. These are as follows:  1.5.1 Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and Sexually   Transmitted Infections (STIs)  Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and Sexually Transmitted  Infections (STIs) are non-communicable diseases which  affect the quality of life and have important bearing on  the reproductive functions. RTIs are infections involving  reproductive organs. These can be caused by various microbes  like bacteria, viruses or protozoa.  Improper maintenance of  hygiene of the genital organs or through infected instruments  used in medical procedures for treating genital organs also  result in reproductive tract infections.  STIs are infections which are transmitted through close  physical and sexual contact between individuals. However,  STIs like infections through Human Immunodeficiency Virus  (HIV) and hepatitis B and C can also spread by non-sexual  modes like sharing of needles, transfusion of infected blood  and using infected equipment for surgery.

Proper genital hygiene should be maintained to prevent  RTIs. In girls and women, during menstruation there are  more chances of getting infection because of the flow of blood.  Hence, adequate  precautions with regard to hygiene need to  be followed: one should have daily bath and clean the genital  area with soap and water and stay away from casual sexual  relationships and have responsible sexual behaviour. If sexual  relation can not be avoided, a condom must be used.  In case of problem, treatment from a qualified doctor should  be taken and one should avoid going to quacks for treatment.  One should not feel shy to discuss the problem with the  doctor. Complete and proper treatment of both the partners is  necessary in the case of RTIs and STIs. Menstrual Hygiene The following steps must be taken by women and girls for  maintaining menstrual hygiene: •  use clean home made or disposable pads/napkins  during menstruation; •  change the sanitary pads at frequent intervals, at least  twice a day;  •  if home made cloth napkins are reused, they should be  washed daily with soap and water and dried in a sunny  and dry place to prevent infection. 1.6\\t HIV and AIDS  HIV stands for ‘Human Immunodeficiency Virus’. It is a virus  which is found only in human beings and affects the immune  system in humans. When the HIV  remains in the body for a  long time, it destroys the immune system.  Many diseases like tuberculosis, fungal infections and  cancer begin affecting the body and the person is said to be  having AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). However  any person suffering from T.B., cancer or fungal infection  should not be considered suffering from HIV and AIDS.  Chapter-1 Health & diseases.indd   10 08-11-2016   11:04:48 AM'},\n",

Immune deficiency means  that the defence mechanism of the  body, the immune system becomes  weak, and Syndrome means that when  the individual has AIDS, it is not just  the signs and symptoms of one disease,  but a group of diseases, that appear in  him/her.  When a person is said to be HIV  positive, it simply means that HIV is  present in his/her body. The interval  between acquiring HIV infection and  AIDS may be up to 10–15 years. It  depends upon many factors like the  status of the immune system at the  time of entry of HIV in the body, regular  treatment of illnesses, good diet and  healthy lifestyle that the individual has.  1.6.1 HIV Transmission HIV is transmitted through:  \\t (a)\\t having unsafe sexual contact  with an HIV infected person.  This is the most common route  of transmission; \\t (b)\\t HIV infected mother to her new  born child; \\t (c)\\t Transfusion of HIV infected  blood; and \\t (d)\\t Sharing of needles and syringes with a person infected  with HIV. This is most common in people who are  habituated to intravenous drug use.  HIV does not spread through air, water or food. Transmission  of HIV also does not occur through mosquito or animal bites  because the virus does not survive or reproduce outside the  human body. When the mosquito bites, it sucks blood from  human body and does not inject into it. Therefore, even if  a mosquito bites a person immediately after biting an HIV  infected person, it does not inject the infected blood into his/ her body. Because of these myths and misconceptions, a lot of  HIV infected persons, especially women, are abandoned and  rejected by their respective families and are discriminated by  the society.  2.

Hiv Can Enter Your  Body Through : Sexual intercourse without  a condom with an infected  partner. Use of unsterilised needles  or syringes infected with  HIV. An infected mother may  pass it on to her child  before,  during  or  after  birth. Transfusion  of  blood  infected with HIV.

Activity 1.9 Read the following two case studies and discuss with your classmates the  questions given at the end of each case study. Situation 1 Mahesh and Ratan, both 15 years old, have been friends with a group of boys in  their neighbourhood for the last five years. Their friends pressurise them into taking  drugs including drugs through injection. Both refuse but when their friends begin  to make fun of them, Mahesh, out of peer pressure and fear, experiments with  injectable drugs.  He does not want to be the odd one in his group.  He uses the same  needle that the other boys use. Soon, he is addicted to injectable drugs.  Ratan, on  the other hand, decides to leave the company of the friends.  He even advises and  pesters them to go to the doctor for help in giving up drug abuse. 1.  What was the role of Mahesh’s so-called friends in influencing his decision?  2.   Could Mahesh have behaved differently? If yes, explain what could he have done? Do you know any drug de-addiction centre near your locality? Take the help of your teacher and make a list of de-addiction centres. Put these on  the Notice Board of your  school.  Enact this case study.  Think what would have you  done, if you were Ratan? Situation 2 A daughter of a very senior company personnel was expelled from the school because  her parents were detected HIV positive. The school Principal felt that the parents did  not observe moral behaviour which led them to be HIV positive.  The administration  believed that the incident would have a negative impact on the school environment  and therefore, their child should not be allowed to study in the school.  However, as  per the medical reports of the mother, blood transfusion during an operation was  the cause of acquisition of HIV by the mother.  1.  Is the action taken by the Principal of the school justified?  • Have a discussion in the class with your classmates regarding possible ways of   acquiring HIV and AIDS. • In this case, what would you like to do, so that the girl should continue to  study in the school. 2.

The test detects antibodies produced  in the body  against HIV. As the HIV antibodies appear only  after six weeks to six months after acquisition of infection, the  test will be negative if it is done during this period. This period  of time is referred to as the “window period”. Thus, one should  wait for the window period to be over to get the test done.  Although there is no definite one set of symptoms of AIDS,  when an HIV positive person develops AIDS, he/she has one  or more of the following symptoms like weight loss greater than  10 per cent of body weight, fever and/or diarrhoea for a period  longer than one month and persistent severe fatigue. However,  one should also understand that these signs and symptoms  can be of any other disease. Once a person is diagnosed with  HIV infection, he/she needs to be treated urgently in a well  equipped hospital.  1.6.3\\t Risk Factors for Acquiring HIV The activities which are of high risk for acquiring HIV infection  are: \\t (a)\\t having unprotected sex (i.e. without using condom)  even if one know the person well.  \\t (b)\\t having many sexual partners.   \\t (c)\\t sharing syringes or needles while injecting drugs.  \\t (d)\\t blood transfusion with blood that is not certified as  HIV free. \\t (e)\\t ear piercing, acupuncture, etc. The instruments used  for these procedures must be sterilised before use.  1.6.4 Responsible Sexual Behaviour to Prevent HIV and  AIDS While sexual route is the most common in transmitting HIV as  stated earlier, it is very alarming to note that more than 50 per  cent new cases are occurring in India among the adolescents  and youth. During the process of growing up, important  physical, physiological, psychological and social developments  take place among adolescents. They are attracted towards  opposite sex or same sex, do experiments and are curious  about many such feelings. They act under peer pressure very  often, which sometimes is the driving force behind unsafe  experiments like drug abuse or unsafe sex.

Growth is a characteristic feature of all living  beings. You must have seen seeds growing into seedlings, which  then grow and develop into plants, or pups growing into dogs,  kitten into cats and so on. Similarly an infant passes through  different phases of growth from childhood to adolescence to  adulthood. Although all the stages of growth and development  are significant, it has been universally recognised that the  stage of adolescence is the most critical one.  This chapter deals with the pattern of human growth with  special emphasis on the growth spurt that takes place during  adolescence which means by rapid changes in the body,  psyche and behaviour. An adolescent, well aware of pubertal  changes, must be able to understand and accept the changes  with confidence, and not fall into the trap of escapist strategies  such as drug abuse. Growing up with confidence needs proper  understanding of various issues and concerns related to  adolescence such as growth and development, self-concept  and self-esteem, anxiety and depression, nutritional needs  and sexual desires or any kind of harassment. Understanding  these issues and concerns will help develop a positive attitude  towards gender concerns and building healthy relationships. 2.2\\t Growth: A Natural Phenomenon  Recognition of adolescence as a distinct stage in the development  of human beings began during the early part of the 20th  century. Growth during adolescence is mostly portrayed as  an exclusive characteristic of this period, making one believe  that growth during other stages — childhood, adulthood and  old age is hardly significant. But you would have observed  that we have all been growing up since we were born without  consciously realising it. We can appreciate the phenomenon  of growth during all stages of human life by undertaking the  following activities. 2.2.1\\t What is Growth? Let us understand what is growth? Growth may be defined  as the quantitative increase in size or mass.

It  is generally been  between 10-19  years of age. It is  a period of rapid  physical, cognitive,  socio-emotional and  behavioural changes.  WHO states that-  “there are certain  attributes that mark  adolescence which  include appearance  of secondary sex  characteristics  (puberty), attainment  of  reproductive  maturity,  development of adult  mental processes  and adult identity  and transition from  total socio-economic  dependence to relate  independence”. 2 Chapter-2 Growing up with confidence.indd   16 08-11-2016   11:05:38 AM'},\n",

When the organs of the body grow, the number, the size and the  weight of their cells increase. Growth can be measured in terms  of the change in length, width, depth and volume in a specific  time period. Although growth is a characteristic of living beings,  in all living beings, the rate of growth also depends on nutrition  and living conditions, including the environment at home. 2.2.2\\t Growth, Development and Maturation Growth, development and maturation occur side by side.  Growth is a quantitative increase in size through increase in  number of cells or elongation of cells. Development may be  defined as the progression of changes, both qualitative and  quantitative, which lead to an undifferentiated mass of cells to  a highly organised state. Maturation is a measure of functional  capacity. For example, a child begins to speak by making  unintelligible sounds. Then, slowly it acquires the capacity for  speaking in a manner, which is easily understood by others.  Another example of maturation is when a child begins to crawl  and then matures to a state of walking on two legs. Similarly,  organs of reproduction reach maturity at the end of puberty. 2.3\\t Determinants of Growth and Development Although age related events of growth, development and  maturation in human beings are mostly the same in all cultures,  however, some variations do exist. This is because growth is  affected by both genetic and the environmental factors. Growth  is also influenced by the socio–cultural context. For example,  in the economically backward families, the growth of family  members gets stunted due to undernourishment. But even  in economically sound households, the members may not be  taking a nutritious diet. Many children who eat junk food all the  time become obese. In fact, growth and development of a human  being is a result of a combination of heredity and environment. Activity 2.1 1.\\t You may collect pictures from old magazines or newspapers and paste them on  a sheet of paper to exhibit the life history of a plant or an animal or stages of  human lifecycle beginning from infancy to old age. You may even draw them. 2.\\t In your diary, list the changes that you have undergone from the time you were  nine years old, till now. Mention physical, emotional as well as psychological  changes which you experienced. Prepare a write-up on those changes  particularly focusing on whether the changes that made you feel surprised or  stressed till you realised that these changes are normal and natural. You may  discuss these changes with your friends. You will realise that these changes  during adolescence do not begin at the same age in all the growing children.

Individual genes, however, are not solely  responsible for growth, nor do they directly cause growth.  Several genes jointly control growth. The hormonal and nervous  systems also have an important role to play. Hormones from  endocrine glands provide the requisite environment for gene  action throughout life. For example, growth spurt during  adolescence requires the secretion of adequate amounts of  growth hormones into blood so that the genes regulating growth  of skeleton, muscles and fat become active to the required  extent. Because of inheritance, children of tall parents are  likely to be tall and children of short parents tend to be short.  One needs to understand the role of heredity in the context  of development of body physique. Therefore, one should not  develop a negative or positive image of oneself on the basis  of one’s physique. Also, some individuals have a constitution  which makes them look tall (ectomorphic), some medium  sized (mesomorphic) and some have a small but rounded built  (endomorphic). Thus, a normally growing adolescent should  not base self-image on these factors as they are beyond one’s  control. 2.3.2\\t Role of Environment Growth and development are also influenced by environmental  factors. The role of nutrition, child rearing practices and the  psycho-social environment provided by the family is very critical.  Nutrition: A nutritious diet favours growth. Growth requires  multiplication of cells or enlargement of cells, which depends  on an adequate supply of nutrients. In fact, at every stage,  the body needs a basic level of nutrients for its sustenance.  Nutrition is, therefore, the most important external factor for  growth. You have learnt in earlier classes in your science lessons  that essential nutrients in a human diet are: 1.\\t Proteins and amino acids  2.\\t Carbohydrates and sugar 3.\\t Lipids – fats and oils  4.\\t Minerals – Macronutrients: Calcium, Phosphorus,  Sodium, Potassium, Sulphur, Chlorine, Magnesium. \\t Micronutrients: Iron, Zinc, Manganese, Iodine, Cobalt,  Copper, Molybdenum, Nickel.  5.\\t Vitamins – Vitamins are of two kinds \\t Fat soluble: Vitamins A, D, E, K  \\t Water soluble:  Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Folic Acid. 6.\\t Water  Box 2.2 Deficiency of iodine  in food causes  retardation of  mental and physical  growth.

Case 1: Fourteen years old Suleman and George were very good friends who also  shared their birth date. Suleman’s parents were quite tall. While Suleman was 5 feet  6 inches tall, George was only 4 feet 9 inches. George wanted to be of the same height  as Suleman and would hold on to a rod and hang from it but to no avail. Then they  approached the counsellor in school.  Guess what counselling was given by the counsellor? Case 2: Suresh was a small-built boy studying in Class IX. Not only was he short and  skinny but also had a tired look on his face. After a medical examination by the school  doctor, parents took good care of Suresh. By the time Suresh got into Class\\u2002 XI, he  was as grown up as his classmates. The doctor gave no medicines to Suresh.  How do you think Suresh attained normal growth? Nutrients are obtained from food. Both quality and quantity  of food are important. Food provides energy, and energy  (in kilo calories) is required not only for growth but also for  maintenance of the body, its working as well as reproduction. A balanced diet contains all the nutrients in appropriate  quantities. Undernutrition during childhood results in slow  growth and delayed maturation. If continued into adolescence,  it leads to short stature adulthood. Nutritional needs during  adolescence are more than that during childhood. Dietary  deficiencies retard the growth. The nutrient requirement  however varies among adolescents since rate of physical growth  is not the same in all. In populations with food shortage, growth  of children is delayed. They may be shorter or of less weight  due to malnutrition or undernutrition.  2.3.3 \\tThe Psycho-social environment The quality of emotional and psychological environment  in which a child lives and grows do influence the hormonal  balance of the body, thereby affecting growth. Growth gets  retarded as a result of emotionally stressful environment. Physical and psychological stress together have been found  to influence growth and development in girls with respect to  menarche and menstruation. The age of attaining puberty  among boys and girls varies. Some adolescents show signs of  early maturation, while others mature late. Highly competitive  track athletes who enter training before puberty have been  found to show delayed menarche. It is possible to explain  the delay due to the elevated levels of certain hormones in  blood during severe physical exercise. These hormones delay  Chapter-2 Growing up with confidence.indd   19 08-11-2016   11:05:38 AM'},\n",

Poverty and low  socio-economic  status  lowers  the rate of growth in youngsters.  Such retarded growth in socially  weaker sections of the society  is  linked  to  heavy  physical  labour and the stress associated with it. Malnutrition and an  unhygienic environment is also not congenial for growth.  2.4\\t Self-concept and Self-esteem Growth and development during adolescence do affect self- concept and self-esteem. The concept of ‘self’ becomes evident  in boys and girls as they enter their ‘teen’ age. Several changes  begin to occur in their body and psyche. As a result, the  attention is focused towards ‘self’. As the concept of ‘self’  develops, it makes the teenager develop less dependence on  parents.

Srinivas stops going to school. One day his class  friend Ali meets him in the market and enquires about his absence from school.  Ali: A lot has been done in the class and exams are approaching. Why are you not  coming to school? Even the teacher was commenting on your absence.  I am your friend. Tell me what is wrong. I shall try and help you. Srinivas: He breaks down. We are six siblings living with our parents in a small  shanty (jhuggi). My father is alcoholic. My mother works harder than her body can  allow, for earning some money for the family. There is never enough to eat. We are  always fighting. On top of that the bullies of the class tease me. In any case, I need to  supplement family income by taking up a job. Analyse the situation, which led to slower growth and natural development in Srinivas. What are the factors affecting the growth of Srinivas? If you are Ali, what will you do.

They come to school together as they are also  neighbours. When they were 12, Neeta began to  menstruate. Sheena showed breast development  but no signs of menarche even when she was 14.  Both friends spoke to the teacher about their worry  regarding Sheena.  What do you think the teacher said which rid them  of their anxiety?

Grooming oneself to look  beautiful or handsome to others is always at the back of the  mind of young boys and girls.  Support and guidance from parents and teachers and  friendship with peers help in developing ‘positive self-esteem’.  Self-esteem is also a kind of self-recognition. It is important for  growing up with confidence. The consequences of low self-esteem and self-image are  detrimental to efficiency. Try to have high self-esteem and a  positive self-image.  Peer group is important because friends and peers may help  to sort out confusions regarding rapidly occurring changes in  the body. Similar changes in friends of the same age reassure  that all is normal. As adolescents grow, they emotionally move  further from parents to become independent adults. Acceptance  among peers becomes important. Company of wrong peers or  adults becomes risky during early adolescence.  2.5\\t Psychological Security  For developing self-confidence and self-esteem, it is essential  to have a stress-free environment. Adolescence is a period  of losses—loss of childhood, loss of sexual innocence, loss  of freedom from responsibility. Adolescents need parental  support to cope with these losses.  Psychological security depends a lot on how a boy or girl  was valued by the family as a child. You may have seen that  teenagers who have experienced encouragement from others  with respect to values and parental expectations tend to be  psychologically more secure than those who are subjected as  children to shame and punishment.  A psychologically secure teenager  is able to concentrate on studies,  have respect for parents, spend time  judiciously on hobbies and establish  healthy relationships. Adolescence has to  be viewed as a period of gains too— the  adolescent attains a beautiful physique,  figure and face. Another gain is the  maturity of brain, which leads to rational  thinking and better understanding of  subjects and issues. But to ignore the  losses and carry the gains forward,  support  from  parents/guardians,  teachers, and peers goes a long way in  helping the youngsters cope with changes  occurring  during adolescence.

Psychologically insecure individuals may even  attempt suicide. 2.6\\t Anxiety and Depression  During growing up, adolescents also become victims of anxiety  and depression. 2.6.1  Anxiety    Anxiety is not abnormal. Everyone gets the feeling of anxiety  sometime or the other. Anxiety is an apprehension of something  unpleasant or some danger. It causes mental discomfort and  pain. It may sometimes prove to be useful, for example, before  an examination or competition. But an abnormally high level  of anxiety is counter productive as it distracts and lowers the  span of attention. Adolescents sometimes panic out of anxiety  without knowing the reason. They may even feel a fear of  failure in future. This makes them tense and tired. Anxiety may  Box 2.4 Read carefully the following situations and try to respond to the given questions.

We will need additional light to be able to see you on the stage.”  Shalini’s good friend, Madhu, felt bad for Shalini and advised her to use a cream to  make her complexion lighter. “You already dance so well. Can you imagine how nice  you will look on the stage if you had a lighter complexion?” Shalini smiled and said, “Thank you, Madhu. I appreciate your concern but I am happy  with my complexion.

It may also  manifest as over breathing (hyperventilation syndrome).  Anxiety may even be due to separation from parents or even for  having to attend school out of compulsion or due to sex drive.  Adolescents may try to get out of anxiety by self-help. The  right treatment for  anxiety lies in seeking help from parents,  teachers, counsellors and even friends. 2.6.2 \\tDepression  Feeling ‘sad’ or low is common among the adolescents. If  the feeling is short-lived there is no problem. But sometimes  symptoms of depression show up as social withdrawal, need to  weep, eating and sleeping problems, and feeling of dejection and  hopelessness. Depression at times leads to hostility towards  parents, society and peers. ‘Anger’ is sometimes a psychological  reaction for fighting depression. If an individual faces pressure,  he/she should be empowered to access or seek information,  advice, support through appropriate communication from  significant adults such as the parents, teachers, elders,  relatives, peers, counsellors and health professionals. The best  way to get out of depression is to engage oneself in various  types of physical activities and hobbies.  2.6.3\\t Psychosis  Psychosis is a medical term for a serious illness in which  the patient loses contact with reality. The perception in the  patient’s mind has no connection with reality of the outside  world. The quality of relationships declines progressively and  contact with others lessens with time in a psychotic person.  A psychotic may also suffer delusions and hallucinations in  which the patient imagines voices and happenings which are  far from real. Psychosis may result from abuse of alcohol and  drugs, injury and traumatic events.  2.6.4 \\tSuicidal Tendency  Depression and suicidal tendencies often go together. It is  unfortunate that often a trivial problem drives a person to  commit suicide. The person feels that it is difficult to run away  from unhappiness and death can be the only solution. Suicide in  adolescents is mostly due to a sense of guilt or failure. Suicidal  behaviour is usually impulsive. It is attempted to punish the  self or a loved one. Often suicide is followed by a quarrel with  a loved one. It springs from loss of reasoning, which is usually  temporary. For teenagers, or for that matter for everyone, it  is important, therefore, to think about the consequences  Chapter-2 Growing up with confidence.indd   23 08-11-2016   11:05:40 AM'},\n",

It is the  responsibility of the parents to take to the child or consult a  counsellor if they see any symptoms of depression before it is  too late. 2.7\\t Drug or Substance Abuse  Young people are more vulnerable to drug or substance  misuse and abuse due to peer pressure, poor self-esteem, low  achievement at school or family history of drug or substance  abuse.  Drugs are chemicals. Some are used for treatment and  help in recovery from an ailment. But when drugs are used for  purposes other than treatment, their consumption becomes  ‘drug abuse’ rather than ‘drug use’. Many a time drugs given  for medical treatment are also abused as in the case study  given below. Certain drugs serve no useful purpose; instead have adverse  effects on the body. Drugs such as Marijuana, hallucinogens  and tranquilisers which have an effect on the brain and drive  the user into a make believe world of fantasy and provide  false feelings of being free from problems. These are not only  addictive but also have an adverse effect on the brain.  Activity 2.5 Read the following case and give your opinion. Raman, Robin and Rina, students of Class XII, are good friends.  Robin lives in a  hostel nearby. He once got a bad cold and cough. The doctor prescribed a cough  syrup. Robin was soon cured. When Robin was ill, Raman and Rina used to visit  his room regularly to know about his health and extend their help to him. Once,  during such a visit, while Robin was taking his medicine he mentioned its good  taste. Later, whenever Rina and Raman came to Robin’s room, Raman would taste  the cough syrup. He soon acquired such a strong taste that he went and bought the  cough syrup for himself from the chemist. Now he has started consuming the syrup  everyday and does not feel comfortable if he misses it even on one day.  Answer the following questions by giving reasons. 1.   Whether taking cough syrup by Robin is ‘use’? Why? 2.   Whether taking cough syrup by Raman is ‘abuse’? Why? 3.   Think about some other substances which are also abused by adolescents?

Furthermore, substance abuse influences not only  the individual but also the family and even the community. The  person who gets addicted often loses interest in other activities   be it school, job or any other responsibility. As a result,  the addicts are not able to undertake their responsibilities  and become a liability for their families. Furthermore, it is  expensive to buy substances/drugs on a regular basis. Hence,  in desperation, addicted individuals may be forced to engage  in petty crimes.  There can never be any need for drugs if one leads a  meaningful life with nutritious food, physical exercise, yoga,  satisfying occupation and healthy relationships.  2.8\\t Sexual Harassment or Sexual Abuse  Sexual harassment is described as any unwelcome sexual  gesture or behaviour, whether directly or indirectly–physical  contact or advance, showing pornography, a demand or quest  for sexual favour, or any other unwelcome physical, verbal/ nonverbal conduct. It also includes molestation and rape. It is  a criminal act and a punishable offence. Young girls and boys  often become target of sexual harassment/abuse by older and  powerful people. As per the research, a person who is engaged  in sexual abuse of young girls and/or boys is often known to  them. Boys are equally vulnerable to sexual abuse. The black  mailers usually threat the youngsters of serious consequences  if they tell anyone. In such cases, the girl/boy being abused  must immediately inform parents/or any trusted member for  protection.

              "  'text': '3.1\\t Introduction The concept of physical education is generally understood  as organisation of some games, sports or physical education  activities  in schools. There are schools where specific periods  are allocated for this subject in the time table. It has been  noticed that during such periods, most of the students are  either left on their own to play the games in a way they like  or they are taken to the field where they engage themselves  in different sports without the guidance or supervision of  teachers. In some schools, selected students play games like  football, cricket, volleyball, hockey, basketball, and so on.  Annual sports are organised, but again in such activities only  a few selected students participate. All  these experiences taken together provide  a basic understanding of the physical  education as a concept. However, when  we go into details of the aims, objectives  and concepts of physical education, we  learn that they go beyond these traditional  beliefs.   3.2\\t Physical Education As we know, education, particularly  school education, aims at the holistic  development of children. It provides  students with opportunities to grow and  develop as adults to be useful for the  society. It is important for us to know that  one of the most important requirements  for growing into healthy adulthood is the  physical growth which supports cognitive  development. It is, therefore, necessary  that all children get adequate opportunity  to participate in free play, informal and  formal games, sports and yoga activities.  It is in this context that health has been  made a significant component of the  subject of Physical Education in the  school education system of the country.  The  subject  “Health  and  Physical  Physical Education Box 3.1 Definitions 1. \\tAccording to Webster’s Dictionary  \\t Physical education is a integral part  of education which gives instructions  in the development and care of the  body ranging from simple calisthenic  exercises to a course of study providing  training in hygiene, gymnastics and  the performance and management of  athletics games.  2. \\tColumbia Encyclopaedia \\t Physical education and training, is  an organised instruction in motor  activities that contribute to the  physical growth, health and body  image of the individual. 3. \\tCentral Advisory Board of Physical  Education and Recreation defines  Physical education as an education  through physical activities for the  development of total personality of  the child to its fullness and perfection  in body, mind and spirit. 3 Chapter-3 Physical Education.indd   30 08-11-2016   11:08:01 AM'},\n",

              "  'text': 'Physical Education\\t 31 Education” adopts a holistic definition of health within which  physical education and yoga contribute to the physical, social,  emotional and mental development of a child. In view of the above, the meaning of physical education  becomes a little different from what is commonly understood.  Physical education comprises holistic education for the  development of personality of the child to its fullest and  perfection in body, mind and spirit through engaging in regular  physical activities. Physical education through the medium of  physical activities helps individuals to attain and maintain  physical fitness. It contributes to physical efficiency, mental  alertness and the development of qualities like perseverance,  team spirit, leadership and obedience to rules. It develops  personal and social skills among the learners and makes a  positive impact on their physical, social, emotional and mental  development. It also contributes to the total health of learners  and the community. Physical education thus, can be defined  as a subject that is not only focused on physical fitness but is  also concerned with development of a number of skills, abilities  and attitudes for leading a healthy lifestyle. It inculcates values  like cooperation, respect to others, loyalty, self-confidence,  winning with grace and losing with hope. 3.3\\t Objectives of Physical Education As discussed above, by now it may be clear to you that the  aim of physical education is not only physical development  but also to equip learners with knowledge, skills, capacities,  values, and the enthusiasm to maintain and carry on a healthy  lifestyle.  It promotes physical fitness, develops motor skills  and the understanding of rules, concepts and strategies of  playing games and sports. Students learn to either work as  part of a team, or as individuals in a wide variety of competitive  activities. The main objectives of physical education are to: • \\tdevelop motor abilities like strength, speed, endurance,  coordination, flexibility, agility and balance, as they are  important aspects for good performance in different  games and sports. • \\tdevelop techniques and tactics involved in organised  physical activities, games and sports. • \\tacquire knowledge about human body as its functioning  is influenced by physical activities. • \\tunderstand the process of growth and development  as participation in physical activities has positive  relationship with it. • \\tdevelop socio-psychological aspects like control of  emotions, balanced behaviour, development of leadership  and followership qualities and team spirit through  participation in games and sports.

It includes many topics  which belong to other subjects like science, biology, genetics,  psychology and sociology. It is possible that all the contents  that constitute the scope of physical education may not find a  place in the syllabus meant for school education. However, it  contains all the content areas as stated below. 3.4.1\\t Games and Sports as a Cultural Heritage The games and sport activities that you play today have a  strong linkage to our culture. Sport activities which dominate  any region is embedded in the cultural milieu. Some of the  sports that reflect the culture of a region of our country are  Kho-Kho, Kabbadi, Archery, Lezim, Wrestling and so on. Our  ancestors survived on hunting with the use of throwing  stones as well as bow and arrows, running, jumping etc.  were used for survival and recreation. Later when man  became more civilised, it took the shape of competitive  sports like athletics, wrestling, archery and so on. So, we  can see a strong bonding of our culture in the present  evolution of games and sports.  3.4.2\\t Mechanical Aspects in Physical Education Physical  education  takes  into  consideration  the  mechanical aspects of various physical activities  being performed. You are aware that the concepts  regarding laws of motion, lever, force and its generation,  maintenance of equilibrium, centre of gravity and its  impact on movements, law of acceleration, speed and  Activity 3.1 1.\\t Find out the following facts about your school and prepare a write-up.  • \\tPeriods allocated for physical education in your school? \\t • \\tWhat do students do during physical education periods?

In addition, muscles and their properties, effect of exercise  on various systems of the body (like circulatory, respiratory,  muscular, digestive and skeletal systems) are also linked to  physical activities. 3.4.4\\t Health Education and Wellness Contents in Physical  Education Physical education includes contents related to the area  of health education through understanding the concept of  hygiene, knowledge about various communicable and non- communicable diseases, problems relating to health and their  prevention, proper nutrition and balanced diet. Community  health, school health service programme, assessment of health  status, prevention, safety and first aid for common injuries are  also included in the scope of physical education. 3.4.5\\t Psycho-social Content of Physical Education  Psycho-social aspect of physical education extends to the  study of areas regarding individual differences, personality  development, learning of various skills, motivation and its  techniques, anxiety management, ethical and social values,  group dynamics, cooperation, cohesiveness and learning. It  also focuses on emotional development, relationships with  peer/parents and others, self concept and self esteem. 3.4.6\\t Talent Identification and Training Content in  Physical Education Physical education includes contents with regard to talent  identification, development of components in relation to  specific sport, understanding of various types of activities  like aerobic, anaerobic, rhythmic and calisthenics. Training  programmes, learning and perfection of various movements,  sport skills, techniques and tactical patterns, warming up,  load adaptation, recovery and cooling down are also a part of  physical education.  3.5\\t Teaching-Learning Approach We have, so far, discussed the importance of physical education  as a subject area in the school curriculum.

But as you may be  experiencing in actual practices, this subject has not been  treated at par with other core subjects. It is not transacted  satisfactorily in majority of schools. And wherever it is  transacted, either some knowledge about games and sports is  imparted or only a selected group of students are engaged in  games and sports as extra-curricular activities. Arguments like lack of the needed infrastructure and  equipments, absence of trained teachers and paucity of time  in schools are given as reasons for indifferent transaction of  physical education. In fact most significant reason is the lack  of appreciation of the relevance of this area for the holistic  development of children by school authorities, teachers and  parents.  3.5.1\\t Methodology of Teaching-learning It is generally believed that the methodology of teaching  learning is the concern of teachers only. Learners have little  or nothing to do with it. But this is not true. The teaching- learning methods are concerns of learners as well. Knowing  and understanding that how different subjects are taught  are important for the learners of all subjects, but it has more  relevance for the learners of physical education. When we  talk about you as learners of physical education,  we mean that you have actually participated in the  subject area, rather than merely studied it. It needs a  suitable learning environment and a positive will for  participation. As you now know, physical education  does not mean organisation of a few sports and games  activities, involving only a selected number of students,  and that too occasionally. The following points are  significant for the appreciation of this subject and  the need for adopting appropriate teaching – learning  methodology: •  Physical education is necessary to ensure  participation of all children in free play, informal and  formal games and sports activities. All students must  be involved in health and physical education activities.  Those who choose to excel in games and sports need  to be provided adequate opportunity. •  Involvement of all learners means that even those  students need to be involved, who are at the risk of  marginalisation, for instance, who are differently abled.  Such involvement will empower them to overcome the  Box 3.3 \\t (i)\\t Why do you feel that it is  important for students  to know how physical  education activities are  organised in school? \\t(ii)\\t Should the focus of  physical  education  be  only  on  selected  students or for all?

It is the outcome of a joint initiative of the British  Council and the Ministry of Human Resource Development,  Government of India. Other international organisations, United  Nations International Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF)  and U.K. Sports were also involved. To begin with, this was  developed for the primary stage and it was scientifically tried  out in schools. The tryout has proved its effectiveness. Based  on this experience, the Physical Education Cards (PEC) and  Teachers’ Manual have been developed for the upper primary  and secondary stages as well. Moreover, this methodology has  also taken care of the needs of differently abled children. They  should also be involved in physical education. The notable  features of this methodology are as follow: \\t (i)\\t It ensures that every student  participates  in  physical  education activities equally.

Physical fitness, therefore needs to be appreciated in full  measure. The common perception of physical fitness is the  absence of ailment. If individual is not suffering from any  perceptible disease, then he is considered physically fit. Is it  true? Another significant issue is whether there is a universal  condition of physical fitness which is uniformly applicable to  all. It is not so. Physical fitness of young people is different  from that of the aged. The physical fitness of a sports person  is different from that of the persons working in army factory  or a layman. In fact, physical fitness means different things to  different people. In this lesson, let us discuss various aspects  of physical fitness. 4.2\\t Physical Fitness and its Importance In earlier classes, physical fitness has been defined as the  capacity of a person to carry out the daily activities without  undue fatigue. Physical fitness is considered as a measure of  the body’s ability to function efficiently and effectively during  work and leisure activities. In order to remain physically fit  and healthy, we need to engage ourselves in physical activities  and take measures for physically fit. Physical fitness is an important area of discussion as the  number of childrens becoming obese. The normal physical  activities, which were done in earlier times both at home and  outside as part of day-to-day routine have reduced due to  development of science and technology. The work that was  done manually is now being carried out by machines. The  use of automated equipment such as automatic machines,  remotes, mobiles and changes in lifestyles affect health and  physical fitness. It has become a matter of deep thinking  for  all of us.  Now a days we find increased marketing of packaged food  and diet for physical fitness. Many such health products now  are advertised on TV and radio, and in newspapers, booklets  and magazine. It is important for all of us to understand that  physical fitness cannot be achieved without doing physical  exercise regularly. We should not resort to any shortcut that  Physical Fitness Box 4.1 Physical fitness is  the body’s ability to  function  efficiently  and  effectively  in  work  and  leisure  activities.

Moreover, these products may  have side effects in our daily life. 4.3\\t Need of Physical Fitness and  Well-being  As discussed in the first chapter on Health  and Diseases, the benefits of being physically  fit for the individual are manifold. The  quality of life of an individual improves when  he/she consciously adopts healthy lifestyle  which promotes physical fitness as follows: 4.3.1\\t Physical fitness • \\timproves the functioning of heart and lungs by increasing  the availability of oxygen to all tissues and organs in the  body system; • \\timproves muscle tone; • \\tpromotes the development of good posture, proportionate  figure, and thereby positive body image and physical  appearance; • \\tensures quick recovery after injury and illness; • \\tdecreases the risk of cardio-vascular disease; (like Heart  attact, Asthma etc.) • \\treduces and controls undesirable body fat. When the  individual does excercise, takes proper diet that also  fulfils nutritional requirement, it helps maintain ideal  body weight; • \\tincreases energy level of a person;  • \\timproves the mood by reducing depression and anxiety; • \\tpostpones fatigue and reduces recovery time after  vigorous activity; and • \\thelps people to meet challenges of life, makes them self- confident and delays the ageing process. Being physically fit is important for all the age groups. To  live better life to the fullest and enjoy all the opportunities, one  try to be physically fit.  Physical fitness is essential for each and every individual at  all stages of life. To achieve fitness, various modes and methods  are available. Before adopting such methods, warming up  before activities and cooling down after activities are essential  to minimise any risk of injuries of an every individual. 4.4\\t Components of Physical Fitness Physical fitness can be classified into health realted fitness  and skill-related fitness. The health-related components are:  Activity 4.1 Collect information from people of  different age groups living in  your  home and neighbourhood about their  physical activities that they performed  regularly. Inquiry and record from them, what do  they understand by physical fitness. Analyse their relationship of physical  activities and physical fitness.

The skill- Related Fitness Components are: (i) Agility, (ii) Balance, (iii) Neuro  Muscular Adaptations and Coordinative abilities, (iv) Speed,   (v) Strength, and (vi) Reaction Time. 4.4.1\\t Components of Health Related Fitness  Cardio-respiratory  Endurance:  cardio-respiratory  endurance reflects the ability of the body’s circulatory and  respiratory systems to supply fuel during sustained physical  activity. To improve your cardio-respiratory endurance, try  activities that keep your heart rate elevated at a safe level for  a sustained length of time such as walking, running, jogging,  swimming,  bicycling etc. The activity you choose need not  be strenuous enough to improve your cardio-respiratory  endurance. Start slowly with an activity you enjoy, and  gradually work up increase to a more intense pace. Muscular Strength is the amount of force applied on  muscle or muscle groups, is able to exert for one maximal  effort (contraction).The key to making your muscles stronger is  working them against resistance, whether that be from weights  or gravity. If you want to gain muscle strength, try excercises  such as lifting weights (under proper supervision). Muscular Endurance is the ability of a muscle or muscle  group to exert force against a submaximal load for a given  length of time (or number of repetition) before fatiguing to the  point of failure. Body Composition refers to the proportion of team body  mass to body fat, it includes amount of muscle, fat, bone, and  other vital parts of the body. Body composition is important to  be considered for health and managing the body fat.  Flexibility is the range of motion around a joint. Good  flexibility in the joints can help prevent injuries through all  stages of life. If you want to improve your flexibility, try yoga,  gymnastics and basic stretching exercise programme. 4.4.2\\t Components of Skill-related Fitness Agility is the ability to change and control the direction  and position of the body while maintaining a constant, rapid  motion. For example changing directions to hit a tennis ball.  Balance is the ability to control or stabilise the body when  a person is standing still or moving. For example, handstand  in gymnastics.  Coordination is the ability to use the senses together  with body parts during movement. For example, dribbling a  basketball. Using hands and eyes together is called hand-eye  coordination.

For example, a Basketball player making a fast  break to perform a lay-up, a tennis player moving forward to  get to a drop shot, a football player running the defense to  receive a pass. Power is the ability to move the body parts swiftly  while applying the maximum force of the muscles. Power  is a combination of both speed and muscular strength. For  example, volleyball players lifting up to the net and lifting their  bodies high into the air.  Reaction Time is the ability to reach or respond quickly  to what you hear, see or feel. For example, an athlete quickly  coming off the blocks early in a swimming or track event, or  stealing a base in baseball.  4.5\\t Activities for Developing Physical Fitness The type of activities that may be useful to different aspects of  fitness are aerobic and anaerobic. These are as follow: (a) Aerobic Activity Aerobic Exercise: any physical activity that requires increased  oxygen is an Aerobic exercise. Aerobic activity or exercise is  therefore the same as cardiovascular exercise as it • \\tincreases cardiac capacity • \\tstrengthens the heart and lungs Aerobic fitness is the capacity of an individual to sustain  exercise for a prolonged period of time, for example jogging for  more than 15 minutes, cycling and calisthenics etc. Activity 4.2 Find out your BMI Take your body weight in kgs and height in metres. Divide your weight by the square  of height to obtain your BMI. \\t Using the following norms, ascertain where you stand.                          weight in kgs                     ——————————                      Height in metres2 Below 18.5 kg/m2 - Underweight Between 18.6 kg/m2 and 23 kg./m2 - Normal Between 23.1 kg/m2 and 30 kg./m2 - Overweight  30 kg/m2 - obese Also select randomly five students of your class and calculate their BMI.

With  vigorous workouts, there is temporary shortage of oxygen  being delivered to the working muscles, for example sprinting  or body building. However the early stage of all exercise is anaerobic. This kind of activity is responsible for developing speed.  This form of activity benefits the bones, i.e. their thickness  increases. The different types of anaerobic activities are weight  lifting, sprint races, jumping, mountain climbing, rafting etc. (c) All Team Games and Individual Sports All major games and individual sports require a certain level of  fitness components like strength, speed, agility, flexibility and  endurance for successful participation.  4.5.1\\t Warming Up and Cooling Down Warming up is usually performed before participating in any  games and sports and physical activities. It is important to  keep oneself  free from injury, pain and how to avoid fatigue.  While warming up prepares your body for intense exercise,  whereas cooling down helps bring it back to near normal after  rigorous activity. Activity 4.4 Case: The football coach assesses the fitness of players of his team by making each  of them run five lengths of the football field. One length of the field is 144m. He  then makes a chart with the following parameters to assess the speed of each of his  players.

Cooling Down: Once you are through with the workout  and you reach the end of the game, it is equally important to  ensure that the body cools down. Cooling down should ideally consist of: • \\tfive to ten minute walk or light jog as it cools down the  body temperature and relaxes the muscles. • about ten minutes of static stretching exercises that  include chest stretch, biceps stretch, hamstring stretch,  calf stretch, hip and thigh stretch, front of trunk stretch  and quadriceps stretch. Each stretch should not take  more than 10 to 30 seconds. Intensity and duration of warming up and cooling down  should vary according to the nature of workout or game. The  more rigorous the workout or game, the more rigorous should  be the warm up and cool down.

We talk of training  of teachers, administrators, police and army personnel, medical  and paramedical functionaries including, working in non- governmental organisations and volunteers engaged in various  events. In these contexts, by training we mean, an organised  and systematic instructional process which aims at improving  an individuals’ ability to play their assigned roles effectively and  meaningfully. However, this kind of understanding of the term  training cannot be applied to the concept of sports training.  The term sports training is specifically used in the context of  athletics, sports and games which could be a training of sports  persons, coaches and teachers of physical education. It is  also used by scientists and experts who belong to the field of  sports science and medicine, sports bio-mechanics, exercise  physiology, sports psychology and other fields like yoga and  science movement. But even in these contexts, the concept  of sports training is understood differently. In this chapter,  therefore, we shall learn the meaning of sports training, its aims,  characteristics and principles and also about sports skills.   5.2 \\t Sports Training: Meaning  Sports training is a special process of preparation of sports  persons based on scientific principles aimed at improving and  maintaining higher performance capacity in different sports  activities. It is a particular type of training designed to improve  fitness and abilities to perform in a given sport. It includes  strength in training, corrective and restorative exercises,  conditioning and cardiovascular training. It also includes mental  and psychological training and advise on nutritional values. 5.3 \\t Performance Development Through Sports Training Sports training is especially focused on optimal performance in  a particular sport. Its main aim is to develop the performance  capacity of sports persons, so that they achieve the highest  possible performance. To do so, it is essential to be mentally  strong. The ability to manage stress and anxiety associated  with different sports need to be strengthened. Competition in  sports makes the participants face varied situations which  require the individuals to be mentally fit.

Every sport activity needs specific type of  physical fitness, and hence, the improvement of various  components of physical and skills related fitness like  strength, speed, coordination, endurance and flexibility  is an important aim and objective of sports training. 2.\\t Acquisition of sports skills: This includes motors skills  as well as basic movement skills. Fundamental motor  skills are prerequisites to the learning of sport-specific  skills. Every sports activity requires to observe certain  specific movement procedure to tackle a particular task.  This movement procedure is known as technique and  when this technique is learnt and perfected, it leads to  skill development. Whenever sports persons include in  technical training, they focus on acquisition of motor  skills relevant to a particular sport. Fundamental motor  skills such as hopping, jumping, skipping, kicking,  throwing, catching and striking are prerequisites to the  learning of sport specific skills of basketball, football,  gymnastics, tennis, cricket, badminton etc.  3.\\t Improvement of tactical efficiency:  Tactical training  is designed to improve various strategies and is based  upon analysis of the tactics of opponents. Specific  training in sports helps the sports persons to make  the best use of their abilities and techniques so that  the chances of success in competition are increased.  The training develops three kinds of tactics: offensive,  defensive and high performance tactics. Tactical  efficiency is enhanced by providing the sports persons  with knowledge of rules and repeated opportunities to  perfect tactical abilities in them. 4.\\t Improvement of mental abilities are critical for high  level performance in any sport. The training aims at  development of positive attitude towards sports and  competition, dedication and devotion towards particular  sport or event, sincerity and honesty, self-confidence  and optimum level of aspiration.  5.5\\t Characteristics of Sports Training Some of the important characteristics of sports training are: 1.\\t Sports Training is Individual-specific:  The needs of  every individual for performing in a particular sport are  different from those of another. If we take the example  of the sprint event, even a small difference in time and  speed or distance decides the performance record, victory  Activity 5.1 Discuss with  your classmates  the offensive,  defensive and high  performance tactics  that are required to  be adopted by any  team game of your  school, which may  be participating in  some competition.

It is, therefore, necessary to identify the  individual potential during the training. By identifying  their needs, training may be focused at improving the  identified gaps in the abilities of that sports person. 2.\\t To  Achieve  High  Performance  in  a  Sports  Competition: The important feature of sports training  is its focus on enabling the sportsperson to achieve  the highest possible level of performance in any of the  sports competitions. It is a process which is spread over  a long period of time.                                                                                           3.\\t Sports Training is a Scientific Process: It is highly  influenced by the scientific methods, to achieve best  result the knowledge from various dimensions of  sciences has to be incorporated during the process of  training.  4.\\t Coach has an Important Role: A coach helps in  building confidence, boosts morale and acts as a friend  and a mentor. A coach is like a ‘philosopher and mentor’  on the sports field. 5.\\t Optimum Development of Sports Persons: To achieve  optimum performance sports training should be  planned, systematic and scientific and to achieve same,  different means and methods are used. These means and  methods are constantly modified and used in different  conditions. Sports, training is a continuous process for  optimum development and perfection of sports persons. 6.\\t Sports training is an Educational Process: Sports  training is basically an educational process and it  develops all the aspects of personality. High performance  is not possible without developing the personality  because both aspects are inter-related and inter- dependent of sports training.  \\t 7.\\t Sports training is a Process of Development of  Hidden Talent: The training helps in observing and  assessing the performance level of the player at any  given moment. While doing so the hidden talent in a  sportsperson is identified. This talent is systematically  nurtured through the required specific training inputs. 5.6\\t Methods of Sports Training? There are various methods of sports training that are mentioned  below: •  Continuous Training Method •  Circuit Training Method •  Interval Training Method •  Plyometric Training    Method Chapter-5 Sports Trainingindd.indd   48 08-11-2016   11:19:44 AM'},\n",

This intensity work is alternated  with periods of rest or low activity so that the body  adjusts to  work and rest. This method involves more of  cardiovascular activities of individual. 2.\\t Cross Training: refers to training in different ways to  improve the overall performance. Cross training uses  different methods collectively to improve fitness and  increases effectiveness of the training process for every  human. 5.7\\t Principles of Sports Training It is important to know the basic principles that must be  reflected in sports training. These are: 1.\\t Continuity of Training: which is the key to ensure  the best outcome in a sport. The training of the sports  persons has to be continuous and regular. Hence, too  long a break in the training should be avoided and the  condition of optimum load should be created. 2.\\t Increasing the Training Load: there is a relationship  between the load and adaptation process. Training load  should be gradually increased to enable the body, to  adapt higher demands progressively.  3.\\t Active Participation: It is a well known fact that a  player who is passively engaged in the training does not  develop abilities and always remains totally dependent  upon the coach or the physical education teacher and  never develops confidence or improves performance  capabilities. Therefore the teacher/coach must ensure  that the sports persons participate in the training with  conviction and sincerity. 4.\\t Planned and Systematic Training: To achieve a high  level of sports performance in competitions, the training  must be well planned and conducted in a systematic  manner for better results.  5.\\t General and specific training: Both general and  specific training of a sports person are equally important  because general training creates the base and specific  training helps to achieve high performance. General  training needs to general conditioning of the body such  as developing strength, speed, endurance, flexibility,  agility, balancing, ability in general.

The training load should be  managed more than the general load. This critical load  should be measured 4–5 times in a year. 10.\\t Adaptability: The adaptability to the training load  should be in proper proportion between the load and  recovery. Then only a sports person gets adapted to  the  training load.  11.\\t Uniformity  and  differentiation: The uniformity  may be in terms of time and duration of the activity,  whereas, the load may vary as per the capacity of  the individual sportsperson. It is an established fact  that no two individuals are alike. The sports persons  participating in the training are different in terms of age,  health condition, individual capacity, recovery pace and  physique. Keeping these factors in view, the training  must be planned as per the needs of the individual  sports person.  12.\\t Feasibility: training of the sports person should be  planned and conducted to draw the maximum benefit.  Too little or too much training needs to be avoided. 5.8\\t Training Load As is evident from the above, in sports training, the load is  a major concern. Efforts should be made so that possible  work can be done with minimum effort. Load is defined as  the amount of work done by an individual’s body. It is the  psychological and physiological demand put on the body  parts through motor stimuli resulting in improvement and  maintenance of higher performance capacity.

Though this increased load does not  affect the sports person immediately, if the administration of  the overload continues for a longer period, it results in decrease  of his/her performance. The important signs and symptoms  of over load are: (i) fatigue, (ii) decline in performance, (iii)  loss of interest in sports, (iv) loss of concentration, (v) lack of  motivation, (vi) sleep disorder and (vii) loss of appetite (viii)  prone to injuries. 5.8.2\\t Adaptation Process and Training Load Adaptation is defined as the adjustment of physical and  psychological functional systems to the training load.  Adaptation to a load results in the enhancement of performance  capacity. Thus, a sports person is able to increase his/her  performance as a result of adaptation process. Adaptation  process demands that a sports person maintains regularity in  training. If a sports person is exposed to new and unfamiliar  load in a systematic planned way the adaptation process will  be faster.  Activity 5.3 Discuss individual experience of members of the team of your school, who play  either Volleyball, Kho-Kho, Football or any other sport and who are trained by the  physical education teacher/coach.  Some discussion point could be: \\t (a)\\t What type of training method is being practised? \\t (b)\\t How the training load was increased? \\t (c)\\t Did they feel that the increase in training load improved their performance? \\t (d)\\t Did they feel comfortable with the increase in the training load? \\t (e)\\t Did anyone get injuries because of the increase in the training load? If yes,  what kinds of injuries they got?  Note down their answers, prepare a report based on their answers and share the  report in your class.

Gradually  human beings started organising events including games and  sports as community events. Consequently, the need was felt  to acquire specific skills and advancement in many sports.  Each sport has its specific skills which need to be developed  for playing correctly. In this chapter we are going to discuss  how some individual sports have evolved and how to develop  proficiency in playing these sports. Rules and regulations of  these sports are revised from time to time by there federations. 6.2 Badminton Badminton is a game which is played by men,  women (Singles/Doubles) and both men and  women ( Mixed Doubles) together. It can be played  by persons of all ages. The first set of rules were  formulated in Pune, in India in 1901. These rules  were gradually adopted by other nations. Due to this  reason, it is believed that badminton originated in  India. However, the game became an international  sport after the first All England Championship.  In 1934, the International Badminton Federation  (IBF) was formed and the rules of the game were  standardised. World Badminton Federation (WBF)  regulates the game. Badminton Association of India  came into existence in 1934 and various State  Badminton Associations are affiliated to it. 6.2.1\\t Types of Events • \\tSingles (boys, girls),  • \\tDoubles (boys, girls), • \\tMixed Doubles (Combination of a boy and a girl) 6.2.2\\t Facilities and Equipment  • \\tFor playing badminton, a racket, net and shuttle cock \\t are required. • \\tCourt measurements: The length and width of the  doubles court shall be of 13.40m × 6.10m. The height of  the net is 1.55m at the sides and 1.52m at the centre. Individual Sports 6 Box 6.1 It is important to note that  playing any sport: • strengthens heart muscles; • reduces hypertension; • helps in keeping optimal weight  as per height; and • helps in preventing of bone  related disorders. If played at least for 30 minutes  a day after adequate warming  up it keeps you feeling strong,  motivated, stress-free, having  high self-esteem and induces  better sleep at night.

A let may be given, if:    – there is an accidental interference during play,   –  the shuttle gets caught in the net after passing over   \\t \\t the net (except during service).

Compare it with  the Fig. 6.1 given in  your book.   –  the server serves before the receiver is ready.   –  umpire is unable to make a decision.   –  both sides commit a service court error.   –  any other situation as deemed fit. • \\tA player will lose the rally if service is not correct or  server misses the service or shuttle lands outside the  prescribed area, shuttle passes through the net, shuttle  does not cross the net, shuttle touches the walls/ceiling  or shuttle hits twice on the player’s racket and any part  of her/his body touches the net. • Three types of cards are used in Badminton, i.e. yellow  card for first warning due to misconduct, red card for  those who have been previously warned and black card  for disqualifying a player for persistent misbehaviour,  this shall render a player disqualified for the entire  tournament. 6.2.4\\t Fundamental Skills of Badminton The Forehand Grip The grip is very important for a player.  The racket is held with  a shake hand grip. The 'v' between the thumb and fore fingers  runs down the middle of the side of the handle as shown in  Fig. 6.3.  Backhand Grip In this, the player holds the racquet in the  forehand grip. She/he then relaxes the grip  and moves her/his hand over the top edge of  the handle until the thumb lies flat along the  back edge.  The strength is directly behind the  backhand face of the racket.  Footwork Footwork is an essential skill for Badminton.  Being agile and flexible, enables a badminton  player move all over the court efficiently in  accordance with a Forehand, Backhand, Drop,  Drive shot etc. and these are given below: Strokes • \\tForehand stroke - The stroke which is  hit from the right side of the body by the  right handed player. • \\tBackhand stroke - The stroke which is  hit from the left side of a right handed player. • \\tSmash - The player will jump upwards, sideways and  backwards and the shuttle is hit (smashed) quickly and  forcefully downwards.

The Service The service is one of the most important strokes. There are two  basic badminton serves: • Long/High service  • Short/Low service  • The player should be centrally located on the court  standing halfway between the net and the backline and  near the centre service line. • keep the body sideways to the receiver’s service court. • using forehand grip the server takes the service position  with both hands between the chest and shoulder. • drop the shuttle and hitting hand is brought down and  forward, forearm rotates upward at the point of contact. 6.2.5\\t Scoring If a serve lands in the court of the opponent without volleyed  back or the opponent returns a volley outside the play area, the  server scores a point. In case of boys, it is best of five games of  21 points with two points lead, e.g. 21-19, 19-21, 22-20 and  21-17 and in case of girls, best of three games with same lead  of two points.

In ancient Greek, the word  “Gymnastics” was used to denote the exercise done with the  naked body. Guts Muths, is known as the Grand Father of  Modern Gymnastics and Friedrich Ludwig Jahn is known as  the Father of Gymnastics. Modern gymnastics is regulated  by the Federation International de Gymnastique (FIG) which  was founded in 1881. Gymnastics was included in the Modern  Olympic Games in 1896 and women gymnastics was introduced  in Olympic Games in 1928. The first gymnastics world cup was  organised in 1975. At present, gymnastics as an event can be  seen in almost all the known multi sports meets. 6.3.1\\t Types of Gymnastics Broadly gymnastics has been classified in three types, i.e. Basic  Gymnastics, Sportive Gymnastics, and Auxiliary Gymnastics. Sportive gymnastics is further categorised as artistic (men  and women), rhythmic, aerobics, acrobatics, and trampoline  gymnastics. This chapter deals with artistic gymnastics which  is a popular discipline of gymnastics. Artistic gymnastics  apparatus for men are: floor exercise, pommel horse, roman  rings, vaulting table, parallel bars, and horizontal bar. For  women, the apparatus are: vaulting table, uneven bars,  balancing beam and floor exercises. 6.3.2\\t Basic Skills of Artistic  Gymnastics As you know now, gymnastics is  performed on various apparatus and  for all the apparatus some skills are  identified as the basic skills of the  game. Some basic skills, apparatus  wise are listed below:  1. Floor Exercises  Floor exercises are done on floor  carpet. Measurement of floor mat is  given in (Fig. 6.5) • Handstand  is  an  inverted  gymnastics  controlled  skill  performed by supporting the  body on both hands, with the  arms straight and the body  vertical.

The body then bounces on to the  hands and rotates through a handstand before landing  on the feet. (Fig. 6.7) •  Round-off  is  a  common  gymnastics  movement that leads into  many more difficult skills.  It is performed by pushing  off one leg, swinging legs  quickly in a cartwheel  motion and landing on  both feet with a half turn.  It is usually the initial skill  for all backward tumbling  movements.

Swimming is  sometimes used for physical rehabilitation of people recovering  from injuries because it is a non-weight bearing exercise. It is  also a good recreational activity.  Swimming was included in the first modern Olympic Games  at Athens in 1896. The first Olympic Champion was Alfred  Hajos from Hungary. Diving events were added in 1904. The  women’s competitions were recognised in 1912. Federation  Internationale de Natations Aquatics (FINA) was formed at  London Olympic Games in 1908. 6.5.1\\t Facilities and Equipment  • Swimming Pool : The standard dimensions of a swimming  pool are: length 50m, width 25m and depth 1.80m. • \\tEight lanes of 2.5 m width each (10 lanes for international  competitions).  • \\tThe height of the starting platform shall range between  50-75 cm above the water surface; the top surface shall  be 50 cm × 50 cm (Length × Breadth). • \\tWater temperature should be 24oC. • \\tSwimming costume is made of nylon or lycra.

It is  also called crawl because the swimmer uses alternate stroking  of the arms over the water surface with up and down kick  action of legs. In turning after finishing one length, some body  part of the swimmer should touch the wall. The swimmer lies flat on his/her stomach with both arms  stretched out in front, passing by the side of ears and the water  level is at hair line. Both legs are extended to the back with toes  pointed. The arms are pulled alternately from front to back  inside the water and recovered from outside the water. While  one arm is pulling and pushing, the other arm is recovering.   The legs move alternately up and down. While one leg kicks  downward, the other leg recovers upward.  The knees are flexed  with toes pointed during the down beat and are kept straight  with toes relaxed during the up beat. The swimmer takes the breath through the mouth by  turning the head to the side of the pushing arm at the beginning  of recovery.  Soon the face goes back into the water and the  swimmer breathes out more through the mouth and only a  small portion through the nose.

During a turn, the swimmer should bend from the stomach  and take flip turn. Some body part of the swimmer should  touch the wall and he/she should finish in the back position  only. The basic body position for the back stroke is the supine  position.  The swimmer lies flat on his/her back with both  arms stretched out back over head, passing by the side of ears.  Face is out of the water and both legs are extended forward  with toes pointed.  Hips are just below the water surface. The arms are pulled alternately from back to front inside  the water and recovered from outside the water with straight  arm over the body.  While one arm is pulling and pushing, the  other arm is recovering. The legs move alternately up and down.  The leg movement  originates from the hip joint.  While one leg kicks downward,  the other leg recovers upward. The knees are flexed with toes  pointed during the up beat and are kept straight with toes  relaxed during the down beat.  Breathing in back stroke is very  easy, as the mouth and nose are usually over the water.  The  swimmer breathes once in every arm cycle.

The kicking action is in circular motion  similar to that of frog. During turn and finish, swimmer must  touch the wall with both hands. Breast stroke involves lying on the chest, with the arms only  breaking the surface of the water and legs always underwater,  while the head is underwater for the second half of the stroke. Both hands, thumbs together, reach forward, fully extending  the arm at the elbow. The arms will stay in this position until  the kick is completed by the feet. Arms continue to flex at the  elbow. Leg kick starts to push back to continue the forward  movement.  The legs flex at the knee and hips to prepare for  the kick. Breathing is usually done in the beginning of the in- sweep phase of the arms, and the swimmer breathes through  the mouth.  Butterfly Stroke In this stroke, the swimmer must keep both the legs together  and she/he should not use breast stroke. During a “turn” and  “finish” both hands must touch the wall simultaneously. The butterfly technique with the dolphin kick consists of  arm movement with a leg kick.

The shoulders are brought above the water surface by a  strong up and medium down kick. The breathing process begins when the swimmer presses  both hands downward, and the swimmer breathes in through  the mouth. 6.5.3 Before and after swimming the following care should  be taken • \\tTake bath before and after swim. • \\tWipe the body after shower with a clean towel. • \\tSwim under the presence of a lifeguard. • \\tDo not go into deep water if you are not confident. • \\tWarm up before swimming. • \\tStretching and mobility exercises should be done before  and after swimming. 6.6\\t Table Tennis International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) was founded in  1926.

Spin \\t (a)\\t There are three spins most commonly used — top spin,  back spin and side spin. To hit a top spin the bat has  to be angled in such a way so that the forehand - side  faces downward 40 degrees (closed face).  \\t (b)\\t To hit a back spin, angle of the bat should be upward  so that the forehand side faces the ceiling, facing  upward 45 degrees (open face). Swing through the ball,  but much speed should not be used as in topspin. \\t (c)\\t A side spin is used in service. It is a combination of  topspin and sidespin, or backspin and sidespin in the  service. Strokes \\t (a)\\t Strokes are generally offensive and defensive: while  performing a stroke the player should stand close   to the table and take a stance facing the line of play. Now   using a short stroke the racket arm should move from   the elbow in a horizontal plane while the free arm should   move upward. The strokes can be played with a backhand   push and forehand push. Fig. 6.22 : Shake hand grip Fig. 6.23 : Pen Hold Grip Chapter-6 Individuals Sports.indd   73 08-11-2016   11:36:44 AM'},\n",

With one key exception, the rules of the two styles are  identical.  In Greco-Roman, a wrestler may not attack his opponent’s  legs, nor use his own legs to trip, lift or execute other moves. In  freestyle, both the arms and legs may be used to execute holds  or to defend against attack. This style was introduced in 1904  at St. Louis Olympic Games. After a century, women free style  wrestling was introduced in Athens Olympics in 2004.  In addition to the above one more style of wrestling is  played in India which is called the Indian style of wrestling or  otherwise known as Pehlwani or Kushti. This kind of wrestling  takes place in a clay or a mud pit. Traditional Indian wrestling  isn’t just a sport, it’s an ancient sub-culture where wrestlers  live and train together. 6.7.1\\t Equipment and Facilities for indoor (Fig. 6.24) • \\tWrestling is an indoor sport played on a mat.  • \\tThe wresting area can be circle or square in shape (12  metre ×12 metre). • \\tThe thickness of the mat should be between 5 to 7   centimetres.  • \\tThe mats are covered with a non-abrasive vinyl material  which prevents slipping, injuries and is easy to clean. • \\tThe bout is played on a yellow colour area with a diameter  of seven metres. • \\tThe centre circle in the middle of the playing area is of  one metre diameter, generally of red and white colour.

The weight  categories are provided to minimise  the chance of injuries and also  to provide an equal platform for  applying strength and force for all  the wrestlers. The weight categories  are  different  for  junior  level,  senior level, open championships,  world  championships,  Olympic  championships and so on. The  changes in weight categories are  done by the Federations from time  to time. As an example, weight  categories for men and women are  given below.

If the wrestler  holds the opponent on his back for five seconds or more,  this will earn him an extra point. • \\tIf there are no points scored in the par terre position by  either wrestler after about ten seconds, the official stops  the action on the ground and restarts the bout in the  neutral position. This is done to keep the action going  and allow both wrestlers more opportunities to score. • \\tIf the score is tied at the end of a round, there is a specific  tie-breaking criterion that must be followed to determine  the winner. The criteria must be applied in the following  order, moving on to the next rule when one rule does not  apply: \\uf0ad\\t The wrestler with the least amount of cautions or  penalty points against him wins the bout.

This  position starts with one wrestler standing in the centre  of the mat, and the other wrestler squatting and taking  control of one of his/her opponent’s legs. The defensive  wrestler (standing) is allowed to put his/her hands on  his opponent’s back, but may not block or defend in any  other way before wrestling starts. These offensive and  defensive positions are chosen at random. • \\tOnce the offensive wrestler has taken a leg, this is when  wrestling starts. If the offensive wrestler scores in this  position, wrestling is stopped and this wrestler wins  the period. If the attacking wrestler does not score in  this position at the end of this 30-second-period, the  defending wrestler is awarded one point and wins that  round of wrestling. 6.7.3   Skills The seven basic skills are: • stance • motion • level change • penetration • lifting • back step • back arch Stance While in the neutral (standing) position, some wrestlers prefer  a square stance (Fig. 6.25) and others prefer a staggered stance  (Fig 6.26). Either stance can work equally well. The wrestler  should not stand  straight  up  or  leave  herself/ himself open to  a takedown from  the opponent. An  effective  stance  always prepares  the wrestler for a  quick attack and  proper defence.

The wrestler may attack their  opponent with a take down  attempt. They may also snap  the opponent to the mat and  spin around behind him/her.  The wrestler may also sprawl to  defend against a take down and  need to learn to move fluidly and  quickly. All the movements need  to be explosive and crisp. Level Change Before a wrestler shoots a take down, he/she  must lower his/her level. This is accomplished  by lowering his/her hips. When a wrestler  sprawls to counter a take down he/she is also  using level change. In addition, a wrestler may  lower and raise his/her level to force a reaction  from his/her opponent. A wrestler needs to be  able to maintain good posture while changing  levels. For instance, a wrestler sometime over- extends when shooting a take down because  he/she forgot to lower his/her level first. A  wrestler should always bend at the knees, not  at the waist. Penetration When a wrestler shoots for a take down on his/her opponent,  he/she does not merely reach for the opponent's legs or dive  wildly for the opponent's legs. He/she makes sure to be close  enough to the opponent and then takes a deep penetration  Fig. 6.27 : Wrestling Motion Fig. 6.28 : Wrestling Level Change Fig. 6.29 : Wrestling Penetration Chapter-6 Individuals Sports.indd   77 08-11-2016   11:36:46 AM\"},\n",

Lifting A wrestler often lifts his opponent off the mat when  executing a take down as shown in fig. 6.30. He/she  may also lift an opponent who has performed a stand  up from the bottom position. The wrestler lifts his/ her opponent and returns to the mat. The legs and the  hips are most important when lifting. For instance,  when a wrestler shoots a double leg, he/she does  not lift with the back. He/she gets the hips squarely  down and then uses the leg and hip strength to lift the  opponent off the mat.

Team games help us to work  together for winning vis-a-vis respect for each other. Team  games are also good for new learners as these games can help  in building self\\xad‑esteem and team cohesion. For a good team in  any game, the players have to stay together for progress and  work together for success. Below are mentioned some of the  team games. 7.2\\t Basketball You may have played basketball or have seen this game being  played. Basketball is one of the world’s most popular game.  It is a fast, free-flowing, high-scoring team game. The players  throw a ball in a basket horizontally positioned to score points  while following a set of rules. Two teams play on a marked  rectangular court with a basket at each end.  The rules allow  all players to move freely around the court and occupy any  position on the court. All players get an equal opportunity to  score basket. The way in which the game is re-started after a  point is scored or a rule infringement makes it a fast game with  few breaks in between regulation timing. To play this game,  students should learn and practise the basic skills of ball  dribbling, passing, receiving and shooting. Game of basketball  involves neuromuscular coordination and often tall players are  preferred. 7.2.1  History The game of basketball was originated at the Springfield College  of Physical Education Massachusetts, USA in 1891 by Dr  James Naismith. In 1894 Naismith drew up the first 13 rules,  which still form the basis of modern basketball rules. In India,  the YMCA at Kolkata introduced basketball some 80 years  ago. Later the YMCA established at Chennai in 1920 played an  important role in the development of this game. Now-a-days  basketball is one of the most favourite games in many schools  and colleges. The game is played by both men and women of  all ages and abilities. In order to promote the sport nationally  and internationally and organise sports events related to  basketball, Basketball Federation of India (BFI) was set up in  Team Games 7 Chapter-7 Team Games indd.indd   81 18-11-2016   4:39:16 PM'},\n",

The first National Basketball event was  held in Delhi in 1934, every two years till 1951 and there after  it became an annual feature. 7.2.2  How to Play Basketball • \\tBasketball is played on a rectangular court, which could  be an indoor wooden court or an outdoor concrete court.  Basketball court dimensions are 28× 15 metres. The court  is divided into two sections, called half-courts, by the  mid-court line, where the game starts with a jumpball.  A jumpball is when a referee throws the ball up at centre  circle to determine which team gets possession. Two  players from opposing teams jump up to tip the ball, in  the hope that one of them will secure the ball.  • The duration of the game of each quarter is ten minutes  with 2 minute rest between first and second quarters  and third and fourth quarters. Between second and third  quarters the rest is 15 minutes. The duration of extra  time is five minutes. Teams exchange courts in each  quarter. The clock is stopped while the play is not active.

Substitutions are unlimited but can only  be done when play is stopped.  The team with the ball, attempting to score  is called ‘on offense’. The team defending from  scoring is called ‘on defense’.  The ball is moved in  two ways: dribbling and passing to teammates. If  the ball goes out of bounds, due to the offensive  player/team, the possession is given back to the  defensive team. This is a form of penalty, which  results in the loss of a possession of ball. Both men and women wear, a standard  uniform consists of a pair of shorts and a jersey  vest with a clearly visible number, printed on  both the front and back. Players wear high top  sneakers that provide extra ankle support.  The game is monitored by the officials consisting of  the referee, one or two umpires and five table officials. The  table officials are responsible for keeping track of each team  scoring, timekeeping, and individual and team fouls, player  substitutions, alternating possession arrow, and stop–and-go- clock. Equipments – Essential equipments in a basketball game  are: the ball, clocks, score sheets, scoreboard(s), alternating  possession arrows, whistle and clock systems. Fouls – An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent  through physical contact is illegal and is called a foul. Players  who are fouled either get ball possession or are awarded one or  more free throws, which is attempted from a line 15 feet (4.6 m)  from the basket. Each player is allowed five fouls before they  are rejected from the game and cannot come back. 7.2.3  Fundamental Skills We are well aware that to play  any game one has to learn some  skills, To play basketball game  one need to learn the following  fundamental skills:  •\\t \\tPlayer’s stance – Hold the  ball with both hand fingers  open,  pointing  forward,  thumbs upward, feet apart  and the knees slightly bent  as shown in Fig 7.3 Fig.7.2 : Ring, Net and the ball Fig.7.3 : Player Stance Chapter-7 Team Games indd.indd   83 18-11-2016   4:39:19 PM'},\n",

This action of  continuous bouncing is called dribbling.  If dribbling is done on the spot, it is called  stationary dribbling. You might have also  noticed that players perform varied actions  while dribbling. The variations are cross over  dribbling that is changing of dribbling hand at  the front side, reverse dribbling that is taking  180 degree turn from rear side and changing  the direction, behind the back dribbling that  is taking the ball from back side and bounce  it on another side.  •\\t Passing and receiving (Fig. 7.4) – While  playing a basketball game, you need to  transfer the ball from one player to another.  Transfer of possession of the ball is called  passing and a player who receives the ball is  known as receiver. There are different types  of passing namely–chest pass, overhead pass,  bounce pass, baseball pass, hook pass and  behind the back pass etc.  •\\t Shooting (Fig. 7.5) – You might have  observed that a player has to throw the ball into basket  of the opponent team to win the game. Therefore, each  team should make an attempt to score by throwing the  ball in different forms of shooting such as two-hand set  shot, one-hand set shot, lay up shot, jump shot and  hook shot etc.  •\\t Rebounding (Fig. 7.6) – Whenever a player makes an  attempt to score the basket and if it is missed then the  ball will rebound from over the ring or board. •\\t Individual Defence (Fig. 7.7) – While playing basketball  if a team loses the possession of the ball, immediately  player has to turn to individual defence. For a good  defence, following factors are important (i) location of the  player (ii) guarding distance (iii) movement (iv) vision and  (v) footwork.

Also you might  have yourself played this game with your friends.  This is a bat and ball game played between two teams  on a field. In the centre of the field is a rectangular  pitch. One team bats, trying to defend the wicket and  scoring as many runs as possible. The other team  bowls and fields, trying to dismiss the batsmen and  thus limiting the runs scored by the batting team.  Run can be scored by the striking batsman hitting  the ball with the bat, running to the opposite end of  the pitch and touching the crease there without being  dismissed. The teams switch between batting and  fielding at the end of an inning. In general this game  is very popular. 7.3.1  History The origin of the game of Cricket was gradual. The  Hambeldon Club which was founded in about 1750  had played a significant part in the evolution of the game.  It was superseded by the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C)  with its headquarters at Lords, London. Cricket became an  international game with the formation of the Imperial Cricket  Conference (I.C.C) in 1909.

In the 21st century, a  new limited over form, Twenty20 and more recently IPL (Indian  Premier League), has made an immediate impact. Cricket was brought to India by the British. An England  team toured India in 1902-03. An All-India team went on a  tour of England in 1911 under Maharaja Bhupinder Singh  of Patiala. The Indian Cricket Control Board came into being  towards the end of 1928. India entered the international arena  and played its first official Test against England in 1932.  Meanwhile Prince Ranjit Singh of Nawanagar who had gone  to England for further studies, made a remarkable name for  himself in the game of cricket. He is generally acknowledged  as the Father of Indian Cricket although he played only in  England. He will always be remembered through the National  Cricket Championship known as Ranji Trophy.  7.3.2  How to play Cricket • \\tA cricket match is played between two teams of eleven  players each.  • \\tThe match is divided into periods called Innings. During  an Inning, one team fields and the other bats. The two  teams switch between fielding and batting after each  Inning.  • \\tAll eleven members of the fielding team take the field,  but only two members of the batting team are on the field  at any given time. The fielding team’s eleven members  stand outside the pitch, spread out across the field.  • \\tBehind each batsman is a target called a wicket. One  designated member of the fielding team, called the  bowler, is given a ball, and he attempts to deliver (bowl)  the ball. If the bowler succeeds in hitting the wicket (Fig.  7.9), or if the ball, after being struck by the batsman, is  caught by the fielding team before it touches the ground,  the batsman is out.  • If the batsman is successful in striking the ball and  the ball is not caught before it hits the ground, the two  batsmen may then try to score runs for their team by  running across the pitch. Each crossing and grounding  by both batsmen is worth one run. The batsmen may  attempt multiple runs or select not to run at all. • \\tIf the batsman hits the bowled ball over the field  boundary without the ball touching the field, the batting  team scores six runs. If the ball touches the ground and  then reaches the boundary, the batting team scores four  runs.

Many historians are of the view that  the game of Kho-Kho is a modified version of ‘Run and Chase’.  In ancient era, a version of the Kho-Kho game was played on  raths or chariots in Maharashtra. This was known as Rathera. First sets of Kho-Kho rules were framed in the earlier part  of  1900. A committee was constituted by the Gymkhana, Pune  in 1914 for framing the Kho-Kho rules and the first Kho-Kho  rule book was published in 1924 by Gymkhana, Baroda. 7.7.1     Kho-Kho Play Field – Equipment and facilities The playground of Kho-Kho is rectangular.

Chasing Skills •  Giving Kho – a member of the team which  is chasing gives kho by lightly touching his  teammate on the back and says “Kho”. (Fig.  7.28) •  After receiving kho a chaser should take  the first step in the direction in which she/he  wants to go. •  The chaser after reaching the pole holds  the post with one hand and with strongly holding  the feet on the ground. She/he moves body  forward as far as possible to touch a runner  with the other hand. This skill is also called pole  dive (See Fig. 7.29). •  When an active runner touches by  extending an arm, it is called trapping. •  Chaser can bounce or dive to touch a  runner if she/he feels that she/he can do so.  A  dive can be of the following types — sitting dive,  turning dive, running dive, pole dive and side  dive.

              "  'text': 'Team Games\\t 101 Techniques of Getting up  • These techniques can be monkey crawl, standing or  both.  • In monkey crawl, both hands should touch the ground  without the body weight falling on them.  Torso should be  parallel to the ground. Eyes should watch the runner’s  feet but the head should not be lifted up. In this, the  chaser can use any method to touch the runner.   • \\tIn the standing style, the chaser gets up slowly while  turning the shoulder and then decides the direction to  be taken to chase the runner. Techniques of sitting in a square There are two techniques namely the toe method and the  paralled toe method. • In toe method, the players sit in the square keeping feet  apart with one foot ahead of the other.  The player shall  sit with the support of the hands spread out. • In parallel toe method, the chaser sits in the square and  the feet are kept parallel to each other.  Hands are placed  outside the centre lane and fingers form a bridge. The  knees  are kept bent and parallel to each other.   Running Skills  • The runners come in batches of three and take up  scattered positions on the court.  • In chain, the runner runs in a zig-zag manner from one  post to the other. When the player runs around two  chasers in a zig-zag manner from one post to the other,  it is called a double chain. 7.8\\t Volleyball Some of you are already enjoying playing Volleyball. Do you  know how this game was originated, let us discuss.  Volleyball was invented by William G. Morgan in the year  1895. This game was invented as a recreational game. At first  Volleyball was played without a net, throwing the ball from one  group to the other. Then a net was used at a seven feet height.  Thereafter Volleyball became one of the popular sports in the  world. Volleyball can be played indoor or outdoor. Volleyball  was introduced in 1964 Tokyo Olympics.

Sports play a significant role in healthy social  development and interaction. It helps people learn how to set  and achieve goals through discipline and hard work. It nurtures  the development of decision-making and leadership abilities,  while teaching people to manage both success and failure.  Today, it has become one of the most popular activities being  organised at regular intervals. In it’s true sense, sports means  much more than just to compete in a few events organised at  certain intervals for the highest honour of one’s state/country.  Sports is a human activity that contributes to the holistic  development of individuals. It is recognised as an individual  activity which offers the opportunity for self-knowledge, self- expression and fulfilment of personal achievement; skill  acquisition and demonstration of ability; enjoyment, good  health and well-being. Sports also engages us in a collective  effort to pursue human excellence. It provides us an opportunity  for social interaction. It is a source of pleasure, but more than  that, sports inspires, brings cultures together, and can bridge  social divides. Sports can enrich society and foster friendships  between nations. Sports is also responsible for the application  of rules and for  adherence to values such as mutual respect,  solidarity and fair play. Sports today, faces the pressures of modern society and  new challenges. When sports events like Olympic games,  Common-Wealth Games, Asian Games or those related to  Cricket, Football, Volleyball, Tennis, Hockey or Badminton take  place, millions of spectators, viewers on television, internet or  listeners on radio become intensely engaged even though a  selected few participate.  Sports is primarily a competitive activity where winning is  the be all and end all. Do you agree with this statement? Perhaps  that is why, in this highly competitive sports environment, we  quite often hear about unethical behaviour which includes  cheating, bending the rules, doping, abuse of food additives,  physical and verbal violence, harassment, sexual abuse and  trafficking of young sportspersons, discrimination, exploitation,  unequal opportunities, unethical sports practices, unfair  Ethics in Sports 8 Chapter-8 Ethics in sports.indd   109 18-11-2016   4:42:29 PM'},\n",

These are just a few examples of what may go wrong with  sports. There is not just one reason for these,  part of the  problem is that people ignore ethics while making decisions.  It is in this context that ethics occupy a critical place. In the  present chapter we shall discuss various dimensions of sports  ethics.   8.2\\t What is Sports Ethics?  Before discussing various dimensions of sports ethics, it is  important to understand the meaning of ethics.  Ethics, morals  and values are used interchangeably in everyday language,  though these terms are not synonyms. The concept of ethics is  technically understood as a branch of philosophy that defines  what is good for the individual and society and establishes the  nature of obligations, or duties, that people owe themselves  and to one another. But without going into the complexities of  this concept, it is relevant to understand ethics as the practice  of making principled choices between right and wrong: a code  of conduct that guides human behaviour, a set of standards  that guides our conduct. It is generally viewed as the system  or set of rules, norms or laws by which attitudes and actions  are determined to be either “right or wrong”. The fundamental  problem of ethics is determining what constitutes proper  conduct. It defines how individuals, professionals in different  fields, organisations, associations, federation and corporations  choose to interact with one another.   In view of the above, sports ethics is a positive concept  that guides human action in sports. It is defined as the code  of conduct for promoting and ensuring healthy sporting  practices. Sports ethics signifies not just a certain form of  behaviour but also a particular way of thinking. It promotes  fair play among children and young persons via educational  and preventive measures and encourages the dissemination  of good practices to promote diversity in sport and combat all  forms of discrimination.  Every child and young person has the right to play sport  and games to gain satisfaction from the experience. The code  of sports ethics applies to all levels of skills and commitment,  recreational activities as well as competitive sport. It involves  the elimination of all types of negative behaviour on and off  the field. More importantly, it promotes equity and sporting  excellence.  Sports ethics is also focused on equity in sport which should  be an expression of human excellence. It has two dimensions: Box 8.1 Box 8.2 Ethics is much  more than playing  within the rules,  as it covers notions  such as friendship,  respect for others  and the sporting  spirit. Institutions and  adults must be the  guarantors of the  right to play sport  and games. Chapter-8 Ethics in sports.indd   110 18-11-2016   4:42:29 PM'},\n",

It tries to ensure that  sporting excellence must be an expression  of human excellence and performance  and results should emerge from the  deserved and meritorious development of  individual talent. The codes of sports ethics  documented by the Olympic Committee  and other international and national sports  bodies, governments, sports federations  and  associations,  sports  sponsoring  concerns and specialised research institutions provide  a comprehensive view of sports ethics. These clearly  suggest that sports ethics is a set of standards that guide  the conduct of all concerned with sports — the sports  persons, trainers, referees, managers, administrators,  parents, teachers, journalists, doctors and pharmacists,  nutritional expert, sports sponsoring concerns, top level  sportspersons who serve as models and even spectators.  These ethical standards are universal and objective and  are not based on subjective guidelines. They have been  proven over time.  8.3\\t Sports Ethics: Standards What are sport ethics or standards? Commonly described as  six pillars of fair play, Standards are integral elements of all  sports activities, sports policy and management, and apply to  all levels of ability and commitment, including recreational as  well as competitive sports. These are: trustworthiness, respect,  responsibility, fairness, caring and citizenship.  8.3.1\\t Trustworthiness • \\tAlways pursue victory with honour.  • \\tDemonstrate and demand integrity.  • \\tObserve and enforce the spirit and letter of the rules.  • \\tDo not engage in or tolerate dishonesty, cheating, or  dishonourable conduct.   8.3.2\\t Respect • \\tTreat the traditions of the sports and other participants  with respect.  Activity 8.1 •  Gather information from the  literature on sports regarding  the codes of sports ethics  developed, documented and  issued by various sports bodies  at global and regional levels.  •  Collect such codes of sports  ethics  documented  by  government and sports bodies  in India.  •  Compare the international and  Indian codes of sports ethics.

Personality  starts developing since birth, but it assumes great importance  during adolescence, when reorganisation of personality takes  place.  Personality is a very common term which is used in our  day-to-day life. It tells us what type of person one is. We know  that each person generally behaves consistently in most of the  situations. The examples of this consistency can be seen in  a person who remains friendly or a person who is generally  kind or helpful in most situations. Such a consistent pattern of  behaviour is termed as personality. It can be called as the sum  total of behaviour that includes attitudes, emotions, thoughts,  habits and traits. This pattern of behaviour is characteristic to  an individual.  There are various dimensions of personality. These  dimensions are related to physical, emotional, intellectual,  social and spiritual aspects of our behaviour. For a holistic  personality development, yoga plays an important role. 9.2\\t Yoga and Personality Development Yogic practices are found effective for development of all  dimensions of personality.  Let us talk about the yogic practices that influences  development of different dimensions of personality. Yoga and Physical Dimension of Personality: Physical  dimension is related to our body. It means that all organs and  systems of our body should be properly developed and function.  It implies a healthy body without any disease. Yogic practices  like asana, pranayama, and bandha play a beneficial role in  physical development of children. There is a series of asanas  and pranayamas which help to improve the functioning of the  body. Yoga and Emotional Dimension of Personality: Yogic practices  are effective for development of emotional dimension related to  our feelings, attitudes and emotions. There are two kinds of   emotions : positive and negative. For example love, kindness  are positive emotions, while anger and fear (exam phobia) are  Personality  Development Through  Yoga 9 Chapter-9 Yoga.indd   119 08-11-2016   11:41:56 AM'},\n",

For emotional development, positive  feelings, attitudes and emotions should be developed and  negative ones should be controlled, as the negative attitudes  and emotions work as a mental block for the development  of personality. Yoga plays a critical role in development of  positive emotions. It  brings emotional stability. It helps to  control negative emotions. Yogic practices such as yama,  niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara and meditation help  in emotional management. For example, the principle of   non-violence will protect us from negative emotions and  develop positive feelings of love and kindness. Similarly, other  principles of yama and niyama will help to develop positive  emotions and attitudes in our personal and social life and  therefore help in the management of emotions.  Yoga and Intellectual Dimension of Personality: Intellectual  development is related to the development of our mental abilities  and processes such as critical thinking, memory, perception,  decision making, imagination, creativity, etc.  Development of  this dimension is very important as it enables us to learn new  things and acquire knowledge and skills. Yogic practices such  as asana, pranayama, dharana, dhyana (meditation) help to  develop concentration, memory and thereby help in intellectual  development. Yoga and Social Dimension of Personality: Primary  socialisation, probably the most important aspect of the  personality development takes place during infancy, usually  within the family. By responding to the approval and disapproval  of parents and grandparents and imitating their examples, the  child learns the language and many of the basic behaviour  patterns of her/his society. The process of socialisation is not  limited to childhood, but continues throughout life and  teach  the growing child and adolescent about the norms and rules of  the society in which she/he lives . Some key elements of this  process include respect for others, listening carefully to other  persons, being interested in them, and voicing your thoughts  and feelings politely, honestly and clearly so that you can be  easily heard and understood. Principles of yama include these  key elements and are very important as these help us in the  betterment of our relationships with our friends, parents,  teachers and others. Yoga and Spiritual Dimension of Personality: This dimension  is related to the development of values. It is also concerned  with self-actualisation which is related to recognising one’s  potential and developing them to the maximum. Proper  Chapter-9 Yoga.indd   120 08-11-2016   11:41:56 AM'},\n",

For spiritual development, yama, niyama,  pratyahara and dhyana (meditation) are helpful. Yama and  niyama help to develop our moral values while pranayama,  and meditation help us to realise our true self. Introspection is  very effective for the development of ‘self’. 9.3\\t Yogic Practices for Personality Development In the following section, we will discuss some yogic practices  which contribute to the development of various dimensions of  personality. We begin with Surya Namaskara. Prepare the body by  performing yogic micro practices. 9.3.1 Surya Namaskara (Sun Salutation)  Surya means ‘sun’ and namaskara means ‘salutation’ or  ‘bowing down’.  It consist of 12 postures. The regular practice of  surya namaskara helps improve blood circulation throughout  the body and maintain health, and thereby helps one to remain  disease-free. Postures practised during surya namaskara act as  a good link between warm-ups and asanas. Surya namaskara  should preferably be done at the time of sunrise. It can be  done any time on an empty stomach. However, morning is  considered to be the best time for it. Adolescents should start  doing surya namaskara daily to have healthy body and mind. Yama (Restraint) and Niyama (Observance) Yama and Niyama are  principles which need to be adopted  always in our day-to-day life. These can be considered as  the universal codes of conduct that help us in following high  standards in our personal and social life. Principles of yama  are concerned with one’s social life; while the principles of  niyama are concerned with one’s personal life. Yama and  niyama are part of Ashtanga yoga. The five principles of yama are: Ahimsa (non-violence),  Satya (truthfulness); Asteya (non‑stealing); Brahmcharya  (abstinence) and Aparigraha (non-collectiveness). The five principles of niyama are: Shaucha (cleanliness);  Santosha (satisfaction); Tapas (austerity); Swadhyaya  (study of good literature and knowing about the 'self') and  Ishwarpranidhana (dedication to the God/Supreme power).

Let us perform Agnisara by following the steps given  below:  1.\\t Stand erect with the feet apart from each other. 2.\\t Keep the hands on thighs above the knee. Exhale  completely. 3.\\t Bend the knees and the upper part forward. Chapter-9 Yoga.indd   143 08-11-2016   11:42:15 AM'},\n",

Benefits • It strengthens the abdominal muscles and nerves. • It improves the gastric fire and stimulates appetite. • It alleviates constipation and sluggishness of liver. • It alleviates dullness and depression. Limitation  • Person suffering from high blood pressure, heart disease,  peptic ulcers or chronic diarrohoea  should not perform  this kriya. 9.6 \\t Pranayama Prana refers to the ‘universal life force’ and ayama means to  ‘regulate’. Prana is the vital energy without which the body  would not survive. Pranayama relates to breathing techniques  which help to increase breathing capacity. Some common  pranayamas  include  anuloma-viloma,  bhastrika,  ujjayi,  sheetali, etc. 9.6.1 Anuloma-viloma Pranayama  (Alternate Nostril Breathing) The Anuloma means ‘towards’ and Viloma means ‘reverse’. It  is called Anuloma-viloma because alternate nostrils are used  for each inhalation and exhalation.  One inhales through the  left nostril and then exhales through the right nostril , then  the order is reversed  by inhaling through the right nostril,  and exhaling through the left nostril. This pranayama is  called Nadi-shodhana pranayama  also, if it is performed with  kumbhaka (holding the breath). Let us perform Anuloma-viloma by following the steps  given below: 1.\\t Sit in the position of Padmasana or in any other  comfortable meditative posture.

Benefits • It calms down the mind and improves concentration.  • It improves functioning of all cells of the body by providing  them sufficient oxygenated blood.  • It purifies the blood.  • It improves blood supply to brain. • It helps to regulate blood pressure. • It helps in managing stress by reducing anxiety.  • It is beneficial in many diseases such as asthma, high or  low blood pressure, insomnia, chronic pain, endocrine  imbalances, heart-problems, hyperactivity, etc. Limitation • In the beginning, retention of breath should be avoided. 9.6.2 Bhastrika Pranayama The word Bhastrika has been taken from a Sanskrit  word  ‘bhastra’ which means a pair of ‘bellows’. In this pranayama,  the action of a bhastra or bellows are imitated. In this  pranayama, inhalation and exhalation are done forcefully in  rapid succession.  Just as a blacksmith blows in and out the  bellows forcefully in rapid succession, dilating and contracting  it, similarly breath is taken in and out by dilating and  contracting the stomach in forced and rapid succession.

This may be called  uddiyana because it raises the diaphragm up. In this bandha,  the diaphragm is made to fly up from its original position and  held very high in the thoracic cavity. This bandha exercises the diaphragm and the ribs. It can  be practised either in sitting or in standing position.  Let us perform Uddiyana Bandha by following the steps  given below: 1.\\t Sit in Padmasana, Vajrasana or Sukhasana. Keep the  hands on knees. 2.\\t Exhale through the mouth emptying the lungs as much  as possible. Hold the breath outside and press down the  knees with palms. 3.\\t Form a pit in the abdomen. For making the pit, contract  the abdominal muscles inward towards the spine and  upwards (abdominal lock). Hold the breath outside with  abdominal lock for as long as comfortable. 4.\\t To come back, gradually release the abdominal lock,  come slowly to the starting position and start inhaling  slowly.

We all know that our mind always remains active and  never takes rest. All kinds of thoughts and emotions negatively  affect it and as a result minds becomes disturbed. In order to  pacify and relax the mind, it is to be stilled. This can be done  by taking the mind away from the external things.  For pacifying and relaxing the mind, meditation is a very  effective practice.  It relaxes body and mind both and refuels  them with energy. Several researches indicate that meditation  improves the functioning of brain.  There are several techniques of meditation. They vary in  the methodology but the goal of all techniques is same, i.e.,  reaching an inner calm and a higher level of awareness. All  techniques of meditation involve focussing on a single point  which could be breath, a mantra, a word or an object. In  the beginning, focussing of the mind is difficult; therefore a  beginner can start meditating for a few minutes only and later  on can increase its duration.   Let us practice meditation by following the steps given  below: 1.\\t Sit in Padmasana, Sukhasana or in any meditative  comfortable posture. Place your hands in Jnana mudra  on your respective knees. Keep your spine erect. Close  your eyes gently.  2.\\t Breathe normally.  Chapter-9 Yoga.indd   148 08-11-2016   11:42:16 AM'},\n",

Remain in this position for five minutes. 5.\\t To come back, bring your consciousness very slowly  back to the external surroundings. 6.\\t Cup the eyes with the hands and blink the eyes for a  few seconds so that sudden exposure to light does not  irritate them. Slowly open your eyes and remove the  hands. Slowly externalise yourself.  Meditation can be performed in different forms. For example,  instead of breath, one may focus on sound also. For this, slowly  produce the sound, keep on reducing its volume till it comes to  a barely audible note. Then stay calm and concentrate on the  tip of the nose or the space between the eyebrows with closed  eyes. Benefits • It gives deeper relaxation. • It lowers heart rate and blood pressure. • It slows respiratory rate. • It helps to reduce stress. • It helps in managing emotions. Introspection In addition to above yogic practices, you can practise introspection  for personality development. Introspection means inner inspection  or self observation. It also means looking within. Introspection is an  important method by which a person becomes aware about the self.  This practice makes us aware about our strengths and weaknesses.  Introspection can be done anytime.  You can practise introspection before going to bed.  Let us practise introspection by following the steps given  below: 1.\\t Sit in Padmasana or any other comfortable meditation pose. 2.\\t Close your eyes. 3.\\t Observe your breaths. Focus your mind on your breath only.  Many unwanted thoughts may come to your mind and disturb  you but try to focus on breath only. Chapter-9 Yoga.indd   149 08-11-2016   11:42:16 AM'},\n",

              "  'text': '10.1\\t  Introduction We all observe how waste is generated in our homes and  neighbourhood and how it is disposed of. The disposal of  waste has been done in a haphazard manner since ages,  be it in villages, towns or cities. But today waste generation  and disposal has become a matter of concern owing to the  enormous increase in population, the changes in our lifestyles  and consumption patterns, huge expansion of industries,  transport, communication and commercial infrastructures  and unrestrained use of modern technology. In fact, waste  management has emerged as a serious challenge having major  implications not only for human health and social life but also  for the environment. It is in this context that this  chapter  deals  with  different  dimensions of waste management.  The focus in this chapter, is on solid  waste disposal. 10.2\\t  Solid Waste What do we mean by solid waste?  Almost everything that we use  degenerates and loses its utility  over a period of time. Many things  become unusable after we use them  only once. We then throw them  away. Everything that we discard  after it loses its usability is known  as solid waste or garbage. There  are different sources from where  solid waste or garbage is generated  everyday from individual households  (domestic waste), and from industries  and  commercial  establishments.  However, all such wastes are not  uniform in nature. Broadly speaking,  solid wastes can be divided into two  distinct categories biodegradable  and non-biodegradable waste. Waste Management 10 Activity 10.1 Bring some waste materials from home. This  can be kitchen waste (for example, vegetable  peels, used tea leaves, some food leftovers) and  discarded articles of use, such as empty jars  of plastic or/and glass, used paper, torn cloth  etc.  • Bury those items in the school garden, or  in a bucket or flower pot, and cover them  with sufficient soil.  • Leave the items buried for about three  weeks after which take those items out  for review.  • You will find that certain materials  have changed their form, i.e. they have  decayed, decomposed or are in the  process of decomposition. On the other  hand, some other materials are almost in  the same form.  • Those materials that have decayed or  decomposed are biodegradable materials,  whereas, those in which there was no  change are non-biodegradable materials.  • Think about the reasons of this variation  and write.

We define biodegradable materials as those  substances made of organic matter, such as plant  and animal matter, that can be easily broken down  by nature. For example, vegetable peels and other  kitchen waste, vegetables, fruits, tea leaves, paper,  wood, etc. Non-biodegradable materials are those materials,  which cannot be broken down easily, and retain their  form for a long period of time. For example, metals,  tin, glass, plastics etc. 10.3\\tSolid Waste Disposal  The garbage that we generate every day has not only increased  in volume phenomenally, but has also changed its composition  due to changes in our lifestyles and consumption patterns. For  instance, there is now an increasing use of non-biodegradable  materials such as plastics, metals and glass, specifically in  urban areas.  Technological advancement has further brought in an  increasing use of electronic items and gadgets. These are useful  for us, but when discarded (known as E-Waste) they can be  harmful to the environment and human health, particularly  for the workers associated with this occupation. In addition, we seem to have lost our aesthetic and civic  sense, and carelessly litter garbage around on the roads, in the  market-place, in open drains, ponds, rivers, seas, and so on.  In fact, we keep throwing a lot of garbage everyday. Have you  ever thought what will happen if the garbage is not removed  from our homes and surroundings? Where does this garbage  ultimately go and what is done with it?  If proper measures  for disposal and sanitation are not followed, how will garbage  affect our environment and health? 10.3.1 Consequences of Solid Waste Disposal  In the cities and towns, collection of garbage is the responsibility  of the respective municipalities. The garbage then goes through  a process of segregation, treatment and final disposal in the  landfills. This process of segregation in our country is still  done manually by rag pickers. (See Fig. 10.1). In this process,  materials that can be recycled are separated, while toxic wastes  are sorted out and kept separately. This process of segregation  ensures that the amount of solid waste, which is ultimately  disposed of in the landfills, is reduced substantially. Box 10.1 In your history textbook  you must have studied how  archaeologists record the lives  of ancient societies through the  material remains left behind  by them. These materials give  us a glimpse of how people  lived, what they ate and other  aspects of their lives. Why do  you think these materials have  still retained their form?  Box 10.2 As a reference, you  can look into the  Science textbook  (Class VII), for the  decomposition  period of both bio- degradable and  non-biodegradable  materials.

Most often we find that all  sorts of solid wastes are dumped together in the landfills, which  in many places, have already overreached its accumulation  level. Moreover, groundwater in the immediate vicinity of such  landfill sites is prone to contamination through continuous  contact with the deposited waste. (Details of the structure of  landfills have already been given in the Science textbook of  Class VI).  In most of the rural areas, people have to deal with the  disposal of household wastes themselves. A common method  is the burning of solid wastes. This may be a convenient  method, but is not conducive either to the environment or to  our health, as it causes air pollution. Many of the villages do  practise composting which is the desirable method.  10.3.2 Effects of Undisposed or Unattended Garbage Open and unattended garbage is a common sight in the  market, streets or in the vicinity of our homes.

Have you  ever stopped to think how unattended  garbage can affect our health and our  environment?  If you observe carefully,  you will notice that when garbage is  allowed to collect in the open for a  long time, it attracts flies, cockroaches  and other insects. It also attracts  rats and stray dogs. In fact, moist or  fermenting garbage, particularly when  organic waste such as kitchen waste  is thrown, becomes a perfect breeding  place for flies. When we eat the food,  which has been contaminated by these  flies, we are likely to fall ill. Water and  food borne diseases such as dysentery,  cholera and gastroenteritis are some of  the diseases that can be transmitted  by flies. Moreover, since accumulated  garbage emits foul smell, it also causes  air pollution. Table 10.1 Types of waste Toxic Waste E-Waste Hospital Waste or  Soiled Waste Toxic waste  causes  serious  problem to  our health  and to the  environment.  Examples:  dried paint,  old bulbs, old  batteries. E-waste consists of  dismantled parts of  computers, electronic  appliances, mobile  phones, TV, floppy  discs, pen drives. In  India E-wastes are  dumped into unsafe  and unauthorised  dumping yards  where they are  dismantled manually  and unscientifically,  causing great  environmental and  health risks as they  contain dangerous  contaminants. Consists of various  components  containing infected  human tissues or  body fluids and are  called bio-hazardous.  The needles, surgical  knives, and other  surgical instruments  called ‘sharps’ have  to be disposed of  carefully, but many a  time we find this does  not happen. Being  pricked with infected  needles can transmit  diseases like HIV,  Hepatitis B and C. Indiscriminate use and disposal of plastic can clog the  drains (Fig 10.2). Moreover, during the rainy season, the waste  may flow along with the rainwater to nearby rivers and other  Fig. 10.2 : Discarded plastic bottles in an open drain Chapter-10 Waste Managementindd.indd   154 08-11-2016   11:44:58 AM'},\n",

This is also called hazardous waste. 10.4\\t  Waste Management and Segregation You must have heard the slogan, “Reuse, Recycle, Reduce  and Refuse.” This slogan is associated with the practice of  waste segregation and management. Waste segregation and  management is a process by which we categorise waste products  and garbage, on the basis  of what we can reduce,  reuse and recycle. We have  discussed earlier that the  volume of solid waste that  is generated by us, has  reached such an alarming  proportion, that government  alone cannot deal with it. We  also have to be aware of the  environmental and health  hazards associated with it.  As it is a problem that has  emanated from us, we must  make efforts to resolve it. By  practising waste segregation  and management we can  reduce the volume of solid  waste. Activity 10.2 You may collect information on the following points. • What method of garbage disposal is practised in your community?  • Who collects the garbage from your home? • \\tDo you ever lift the garbage at the community site? • \\tHow far is this site from your home? • \\tHave you ever observed flies, mosquitoes, insects and stray animals around the  garbage disposal site? • \\tWhat are the methods utilised by the community for final disposal of garbage? • On the basis of the information collected, answer the following questions. • \\tDo you think the method of garbage disposal in your community is appropriate? • \\tIf yes, explain how? • \\tIf not, what would you suggest to ensure sanitary conditions for garbage disposal  from your community? Activity 10.3 •  Make a record of all the items that were disposed of  from your home last week. •  Make a rough estimate of each item  of solid waste.  This estimate can be presented in the Table 10.2.  •  Quantity of waste generated at home in a month. •  Based on your estimates, give some suggestions on  how you can reduce the volume of kitchen waste to  almost zero. •  Are there any items in your waste, which can be  reused or recycled? Make a list of these items. •  Make a list of items that cannot be reused or recycled.  If there are hazardous wastes in these items how will  you dispose them of?   •  You may compare your observations and suggestions  with your classmates.

Segregation at Source The first and most important principle for waste management  is segregation at source. Segregation of garbage at source  should be practised at home, at school, office and markets.  Garbage can be disposed of in separate bins (Fig 10.4). Blue  bins may be used for non-biodegradable and green bins for  biodegradable waste.  At home, you may segregate waste into the following  categories.  (a) Wet waste, (b) dry waste, (c) hazardous waste.  In the cities we find these bins in some places, where  people can dispose of biodegradable and non-biodegradable  garbage separately. Where do you think we should dispose of  hazardous waste? Should there be a separate bin for it? Why? 2. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Refuse We should segregate waste products with a view to reduce,  reuse, recycle and refuse. In Activity 10.3 you have seen that  there are different types of waste that are generated in our  homes. For most of us, kitchen wastes (fruit peels, vegetables,  leftover food, tea leaves) forms a large percentage of the total  waste at home. Composting is a common method to reduce the  volume of kitchen waste to ‘zero waste.’ It is also an effective  way through which kitchen waste can be recycled back into  nature.  There are certain items in our garbage that can be reused.  Reusing discarded items means that instead of dumping them  and increasing the load of waste, we can reuse these items.  Some examples are given here. Fig. 10.4 : Blue and Green Bins Chapter-10 Waste Managementindd.indd   157 08-11-2016   11:44:59 AM'},\n",

It gives us energy that is required for every action  of ours including our participation in games and sports. The  various food items that we consume constitute our diet. Diet  may be defined as the total amount of different variety of food  items consumed by a person during a day.  A healthy diet should consist of simple, natural and/or  well-cooked foods which promote health and protect us from  diseases. It should keep our organ systems well functioning.  The diet that we consume is decided by our socio-cultural  norms, life style pattern and the type of activities we are engaged  in. There is a delicate relationship amongst what we eat, how  much we eat and what will happen to our health  if we overeat  or do not eat properly. In the present chapter, we shall discuss  important dimensions of diet for healthy living, which include  nutrition, nutrients, food groups, balanced diet, special dietary  requirements, malnutrition and eating disorders. 11.2\\tDietary Requirements of Human Body Our diet contains many food items which are obtained from  different sources.

These constituents  are known as nutrients. For proper functioning of our  body we need to consume body building foods (e.g.  milk, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, pulses, groundnuts);  energy giving foods (e.g. cereals, sugar, roots, fats and  oils); and protective foods (e.g. vegetables, fruits).  11.2.1 Nutrients              The  food we consume breaks down to simpler  products before it is absorbed and utilised by the  body. These simpler substances are called nutrients.  Our body utilises nutrients for building and repairing,  obtaining energy and for protection from diseases.  What is nutrition? The term nutrition is related to  our food intake and dietary patterns and utilisation of  protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins and minerals to maintain  our health. Most of the natural food items contain more than  one nutrient.  Let us understand various nutrients contained  in different food items. 11.2.1.1 Proteins   Proteins are called building blocks of our body.  About 20  per cent of our body weight comes from proteins. Proteins  are essential for growth and repair of muscle and other body  tissues. Proteins are made of amino acids that contain the  elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. We obtain  proteins from animal as well as vegetable sources. Proteins of  animal origin are found in milk, eggs, cheese, fish and meat.  Proteins from these sources contain all the essential amino  acids (EAA) in adequate amounts. Vegetable proteins are found  Fig 11.1 :  A Vegetarian Thali Activity 11.2 Find  out  from  your  parents/  grandparents, the  locally  available  fruits and their  value to the health  of the body.

There are three major categories of  carbohydrates, viz. starch, sugar and cellulose. Our  body breaks down sugar and starch into glucose to  provide energy. Cellulose does not have any nutritive  value per se, but is a major contributor of dietary  fibres. Excess carbohydrates are converted into fat by  the liver and stored in the adipose tissues in our body.  Carbohydrates are of two types – simple and  complex. Simple carbohydrates are quick energy  foods, e.g. sugar. Sources of simple carbohydrates are  natural fruits, milk and milk products, and vegetables  including potatoes and carrots. Complex carbohydrates  are better sources of energy than sugar since these are  released slowly. Sources of complex carbohydrates are  breads, cereals (rice, wheat, bajra, corn, barley, ragi,  etc.). We should consume starch and natural sugar  and eat whole grains, rice, bread, cereals and fruits to  obtain adequate amount of carbohydrates. Fast food  items such as pizza, pasta, noodles, etc. are rich in  carbohydrates only and cannot replace a balanced  meal.  11.2.1.3 Fats Fats and oils are concentrated sources of energy. Fats  are substances that our body stores for future use.  These are classified as simple lipids (e.g. triglycerides),  compound lipids (e.g. phospholipids), and derived  lipids (e.g. cholesterol). Fats may be obtained from animal  or vegetable sources. The major sources of animal fats are  ghee, butter, milk, cheese, eggs, fish and meat. The sources of  vegetable oils are groundnut, mustard, sesame, coconut, etc.  Excess carbohydrates are converted into fats. Fast food items  like pizza, samosas, burgers are rich sources of fat. Therefore,  children who consume only fast food items tend to become  obese.  11.2.1.4 Vitamins Vitamins are organic substances that we require in adequate  quantities for good health. Our body, however, cannot  synthesise them. Therefore, we need to consume their natural  sources such as fruits and vegetables. Vitamins are divided  Fig 11.3 : Carbohydrates and Vitamins Chapter-11 diet for health living .indd   163 08-11-2016   11:46:39 AM'},\n",

We need water to break down complex food  molecules, and transport food, chemicals and gases throughout  the body. It acts as the medium for biochemical reactions and  is also required to eliminate the wastes as urine and sweat. We  should take 8 – 10 glasses of potable water per day. Inadequate  water intake leads to dehydration. Therefore, intake of water  in proper proportion is important. We should never substitute  water with coffee, tea or soft drinks.

These needs are directly related to age and physical  activity. During the rapid growing years, i.e. 12 – 22 years for  boys and 12 – 18 years for girls, there is a gradual increase in  daily food requirements. But as we grow old, our daily need  for energy decreases. The amount of energy required by people  engaged in low, moderate or high level of physical activity  differs.  A sportsperson always needs to consume more calories than  a non-sportsperson.  Similarly, the dietary needs of a woman  during pregnancy and lactation are higher. Let us discuss the  dietary requirements of different individuals. Chapter-11 diet for health living .indd   167 08-11-2016   11:46:39 AM'},\n",

Girls need more minerals  like calcium and iron. Adolescent girls and boys need to take  calcium rich food to keep their bones, teeth and muscles  healthy; and iron rich food  to keep them strong. Therefore, it  is essential for them to consume more dairy products, beans  and green leafy vegetables in their diet. Young girls taking  inadequate diet may suffer from nutritional problems like iron- deficiency anaemia and  obesity. This may be due to refusal to  eat food to maintain weight or binge eating habit. Furthermore,  an under nourished adolescent girl is at a risk of developing  complication during pregnancy and child birth. 11.4.2 Diet for Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers Women always require more iron than men. Pregnant and  lactating mothers have special dietary needs. In our country,  it is seen that pregnant and lactating women do not take  healthy diet because of lack of availability and lack of  important nutritional information. A pregnant and a lactating  mother requires additional energy over and above her normal  requirements. There is also an increased need for protein,  calcium and iron. Inadequate intake of nutrients causes  harm to the foetus and the child. Mothers should follow the  guidelines for intake of nutrients available from the nearby  health centre and gather knowledge regarding weight gain and  supplementation. Besides food, normal physical activities and  light exercises like walking should be performed by pregnant  women in consultation with the doctor or health worker.   Good nutrition during pregnancy promotes healthy weight  of the newborn. Low birth-weight children are prone to various  diseases during adulthood. Therefore, pregnant women and  mothers should keep the following in mind.  • \\tInclude all food groups in daily diet. Care should be  taken to include cereals, pulses, ghee-oil, sugar, jaggery,  vegetables, fruits, milk and its products in the daily diet.

Sportspersons  undergo physical training which involves regular strenuous  exercises for a long period for developing physical fitness and  improving performance. They, therefore, need more calories for  energy. Even persons who do not participate in competitive  sports but undertake exercise programmes for physical fitness  need extra energy. Accordingly, they are required to plan their  diet.  Let us have a look at the table given below to understand  the energy expenditure of a person of age between 20 to 39  years, with a body weight of approximately 60 kg by various  activities. These additional requirement of nutrients for training load  can be achieved with a balanced diet. In the past, athletes  were advised to take large amount of protein from eggs, meat  and milk, but it is now generally accepted that carbohydrate  and not protein, is the best source of energy. One should also  remember that extra protein intake does not increase muscles.

In case of sportspersons, a  dietary carbohydrate intake of 500-600 gm/day is necessary to  ensure adequate glycogen synthesis. Carbohydrates break into  sugars that give energy. Extra sugar is converted into glycogen  and stored as adipose tissue by the liver.  It is broken down to  simple sugar whenever energy is required. An athlete needs to  choose foodstuffs from all groups displayed in the food pyramid  and pay attention to the intake of adequate water.   In planning one’s diet, care must be taken to follow good  eating habits that we discussed earlier. Physical activities may  be performed after at least three hours of taking a principal  meal and after half an hour of taking light food. A sportsperson’s  diet is very important not only during the training period, but  before and after the competitions too.

Food may include breakfast cereals, bread,  roti, fruits, fruit juice, boiled rice, potatoes, sweet potatoes,  biscuits and carbohydrate drinks. 11.4.3.2 Diet on Competition Day On the day of competition, the most important thing to remember  is never to try anything new. An athlete must follow a simple  and sound nutritional routine. If the competition is held in  the morning, just eat a light carbohydrate-rich breakfast with  plenty of fluids, cereal with milk, bread or roti. Large quantities  of sugar, confectionery or honey should be avoided. Food that  may upset the stomach and make feel heavy may be avoided. 11.4.3.3 Eating just before Competition Small amount of food containing carbohydrates just before  competition helps to delay fatigue and improve endurance. 11.4.3.4 Drinking during Competition Have your last drink 15 – 20 minutes before actual competition.  It is essential to drink water at regular intervals to avoid  dehydration. Right kind of sports-drinks hydrate our body and  also supply energy. 11.5\\tYogic Diet Ayurveda advise a sattvic, which is a vegetarian diet, consisting  of natural food items. According to yogic dietetics, natural  food items are easy to digest and assimilate. Yogic diet is a  combination of raw food and proper fasting routine. Good  raw food, such as cucumber, radish, carrots, tomatoes,  sprouts, together with spices like ginger, cayenne, cinnamon  and basil provide energy to the mind and the body. Taking  regular yogic diet and performing asanas, pranayama and  meditation contribute to the well-being of our body and mind.  For preparation of yogic foods, steaming is considered to be the  best method.  11.6\\tMalnutrition It is now clear that a balanced diet is very important for a  healthy life. An imbalance between the body’s nutritional needs  and the intake of nutrients leads to malnutrition. Commonly  malnutrition  is considered in terms of hunger, whereas, both  under-nutrition and over-nutrition are forms of malnutrition.

Deficiency caused  by under-nutrition affects us after long term of negligence.  An under-nourished child cannot grow fully, physically and  mentally. In most of the developing countries, under-nutrition  is a threat to public health as it leads to illness and even death.  In addition to inadequate intake of nutrients, under-nutrition  is also the result of malabsorption of food, addiction to drugs  or loss of nutrients from body due to various medical reasons.  Under-nutrition may lead to deficiency diseases, like protein  deficiency diseases which include kwashiorkor, marusmus,  mineral deficiency diseases like goitre, anaemia; and vitamin  deficiency diseases like scurvy, beriberi and rickets.  Ignorance, lack of education and poverty led by relatively  high food prices, natural disasters causing insufficient  agricultural productivity and unhealthy dietary practices are  some important common causes of under-nutrition. Under- nutrition continues to be a significant health problem for  children and adults in India. The National Family Health  Survey 3 (NFHS) reported that in our country the prevalence of  Fig. 11.6 : Under-nutrition children Marasmus Kwashiorkor Box 11.3 Nutritional  imbalance resulting  from inadequate  intake of nutrients is  referred to as under- nutrition.

For  the  management  of  under-nutrition,  improvement in nutritional status is required. The  Government of India provides mid-day meals to the  students of up to elementary stage during school  hours. Many myths and taboos about diet are also  responsible for under-nutrition in our country.  Due to ignorance and illiteracy, locally available  nutritious food is not eaten. In case of new born  babies, inadequate breastfeeding is a major cause of under- nutrition. In fact, exclusive breast feeding during the first six  months of life is very important.   11.6.1.2 Over-nutrition Over-nutrition is also a form of malnutrition that results  from overeating and excessive intake of specific nutrients  like carbohydrate and fat. Inadequate exercise and  overeating are the major causes of overweight. Due to intake  of excessive food, adipose tissue increases abnormally in  the body that enlarges or  the number of fat cells increase  leading to obesity. We find obese persons bulky and  overweight because of the accumulation of fat in the body.  People who eat more need to burn more calories, otherwise  surplus calories are stored as fat. In modern societies obesity has become an epidemic.  It occurs in both developed and developing countries and  affects children as well as adults. In addition to overeating  and inactivity, the major reasons of overweight and obesity  are sedentary life style, emotional problems and physiological  disturbances including genetic factors. Metabolic and  digestive disorders take place due to over- consumption of fats, fast foods, soft drinks  and refined white flour carbohydrates,  combined with low fibre intake.  Overweight and obese children and  adolescents frequently grow to become  obese adults. Obesity tends to run in  families, suggesting a genetic link too,  as families share common dietary and  physical activity patterns, attitude, lifestyle  and habits which contribute to obesity.  Planning for balanced diet and regular  exercise is of utmost importance to prevent  overweight and obesity.

Disordered eating patterns are either characterised by  refusal of food to maintain the body weight or recurring binge  eating followed by vomiting. The former restrictive type disorder  is known as Anorexia Nervosa and the later, Bulimia Nervosa.  Most people do not seek help for eating disorders; some may  not even be aware that they have a problem.   11.7.1 Anorexia Nervosa (AN) (Refusal to eat food) Anorexia Nervosa is a psychological disorder caused by under- nutrition. People with such disorder become thin and lose a lot  of weight. An obsessive fear of gaining weight occurs in such  cases. Anorexia nervosa is an attempt to use food and weight to  deal with emotional problems, physical changes, peer pressure  and stress.    It is a serious mental illness with a high incidence  of morbidity and mortality. Extreme fasting, indulging in over exercise, dieting may  result in  anorexia nervosa. Teenage girls and young women  are more likely to develop this disorder. However, this disorder  can occur during adulthood too.  11.7.2 Bulimia Nervosa (Recurrent binge eating) Bulimia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterised by  recurrent binge eating, followed by compensatory behaviour.  The most commonly observed behaviours include defensive  vomiting, sometimes called purging, fasting, using  laxatives  and over- exercising. Box 11.5 Anorexia Nervosa  results from refusal  to eat or lack of  appetite or disliking  food leading to  starvation to  maintain a body  image.

Bulimia nervosa is rarely seen in those under 14 years.  It  has also been observed that there is higher incidence of major  depressive disorder in close relatives of patients with bulimia  nervosa. The common causes of the disorder are family problems,  inability to adjust in society, lack of self-identity, conflict,  problem with body image, depression and other psychological  problems. The person tries to express emotions that are  otherwise difficult, becomes  extremely engaged with emotions  and is so tied up with a relationship with food and weight that  it becomes difficult for him/her to deal with it. Health problems caused by both the above conditions  include:  \\t (a)\\t tooth decay, toothaches, swollen gums, gum disease  (gingivitis), and erosion of tooth enamel, which are  caused by acid in the mouth due to vomiting.  \\t (b)\\t osteoporosis.  \\t (c)\\t abnormal heart beat.  \\t (d)\\t dehydration, which can lead to weakness, fainting.  \\t (e)\\t fainting due to low blood pressure.  \\t (f)\\t low body temperature.  \\t (g)\\t suicide risks when a person feels discouraged due to  presence of one of the conditions or has ongoing body  image issues. Anorexia and bulimia can lead to delay in the onset of  menstruation in girls. There is a need to focus on fitness rather than on weight  reduction. Sitting in front of TV or computer for long hours,  eating junk food, or having high calorie drinks add to obesity.  It is seen not only in the affluent section but also in urban poor.  Since obesity is more a lifestyle disease, it needs intervention  at the level of the person himself/herself and at the level of the  entire family, school and the community. Proper eating habits,  diet and exercise are the essential requirements for physical  fitness and management of weight.

But it  takes time to reach them, during which if some initial care  is taken, it helps treatment of such individuals and in many  cases saves their lives. We also observe that some of the  minor illnesses or injuries are cured by taking such initial  care. However, this care cannot be taken unless we are  aware and trained in first-aid. In the present lesson we shall  discuss various aspects of first aid and safety. 12.2\\tWhat Does First Aid Mean? First aid is the provision of initial care for an illness or  injury. It is usually performed by a non-expert person to a  sick or injured person until appropriate medical treatment  can be accessed in a hospital or by going to a doctor. Certain  self-limiting illnesses or minor injuries may not require further  medical care after the first aid intervention. It generally consists  of a series of simple and in some cases, potentially life-saving  techniques that an individual can be trained to perform with  minimal equipment.  The First aid training, therefore, is of value in both preventing  and treating sudden illness or accidental injury and in caring  for large number of persons caught in a natural disaster. It is  a measure both for self help as well as for the help of others.  12.2.1 Self-help If you, as a first-aider, are prepared to help others, you are  better able to care for yourself in case of injury or sudden  illness. Even if your own condition keeps you from caring for  yourself, you can direct others in carrying out correct  procedures to follow on your behalf.  12.2.2 Help for Others Having studied first-aid, you are prepared to give others  some instruction in first-aid, to promote among them  a reasonable safety attitude and to assist them wisely  if they are stricken. There is always an obligation on a  humanitarian basis to assist the sick and the helpless.  There is no greater satisfaction than that resulting from  relieving suffering or saving a life.  First Aid and Safety 12 Fig. 12.1 : First Aid Box Activity 12.1 • Make a first aid box  and keep in your  classroom. • Make one student  incharge so that  all students know  whom to reach in  an emergency. Activity 12.2 • Do you know how to  apply bandage? • Do you know what  treatments are applied  for bruises and cuts? • Discuss the above in your  class and demonstrate.

The main objective of first aid is not to cure, but  to ensure safety until the patient or affected  person accesses specialised treatment. It is the  initial assistance or care of a suddenly sick or  injured person. It is the care administered by  a person as soon as possible after an illness or  accident. It is this prompt care and attention  prior to the arrival of the ambulance that  sometimes creates the difference between life  and death, or between a full or partial recovery.  As shown in Box 12.1, the major objectives  of first aid are: (i) to ensure that the victim  reaches the place of specialised treatment safely and life is not  lost in-between; (ii) to prevent further harm, i.e., the injury that  has taken place, does not deteriorate further; (iii) to prevent  the danger of further injury; and (iv) to promote recovery, i.e.,  necessary intervening care is taken in a way that promotes  recovery and relieves the victim of pain and uneasiness.   12.4\\tFirst Aid in Different Cases It is essential to know and be trained in the art of providing  first aid. Though it is done by non-expert persons, it cannot  and should not be administered without acquiring adequate  knowledge and appropriate skill. There are different ways of  providing first aid in different cases of accidents and illnesses.  Let us take some specific cases and know how first aid is  provided. 12.4.1 First aid for Drowning Many deaths occur because of drowning. Death by drowning  occurs when air cannot get into the lungs because of the  entrance of a small amount of water into the lungs. This may  cause the contraction of the throat. In such cases efforts  are made to remove water from the stomach of the drowned  person. Attempting to forcefully remove water from the victim’s  stomach should be avoided as this may make the victim vomit  and there are chances of casualty. A casualty from drowning  needs to be treated by a medical doctor, even if he/she seems  to recover, because, as explained in Box 12.2, a secondary  drowning may occur in him/her at a later stage.  In this particular situation, the aim of the first aid is to  restore breathing, to keep the person warm and to arrange for  taking  him/her to hospital. The following steps may be taken: Box 12.1 The basic objectives of First Aid are: • to give immediate care. • \\tto protect the casualty from  further harm. • \\tto relieve pain. • \\tto promote recovery. The recovery is promoted as the heart  rate goes down, which in turn prevents  blood loss from the victim’s body. Box 12.2 Water entering the  lungs causes them  to be irritated, and  the air passages to  swell several hours  later\\xad—a condition  known as secondary  drowning.

Keep the person’s head lower than the  rest of the body to reduce the risk of inhaling  water. Step 2: \\tLay down the person on his/her back. Open  the airway and check breathing. If required,  give CPR (Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation)  with chest compression. Step 3: \\tTreat the person for Hypothermia (low body  temperature). Remove wet clothes and cover  him/her with dry blanket. If the person  regains full consciousness, give him/her a  warm drink. Step 4: \\tCall   for   a   doctor or ambulance to transport  the person to the nearest hospital as soon  as possible, even if she/he appears to have  recovered fully. 12.4.2 First aid for Fire Injuries When the skin comes in direct contact with fire, it gets  damaged. This is known as dry burn. The burn exposes  the under lying part of the skin, which increases the  chances of infection. While assessing the burn, it is  necessary to: • \\tconsider the circumstances in which the burn  has occurred; • \\testablish the cause of the burn; • \\tobserve the condition of the victim; does she/he  need immediate medical attention? • \\tassess the extent of burn or the depth of the  burn; and • \\tdetermine the degree of risk for infection. Based on the depth of the skin damage, the burns are  categorised into three types. Box 12.3 Warning – Water in the lungs can  increase  the  resistance  to  rescue  breathes and chest compressions, so  these have to be done at a slower rate.  Hypothermia develops when the body  temperature falls bellow 35° Celsius.  The effects vary depending on the speed  of onset and the level to which the body  temperature falls. Activity 12.3 The students should be encouraged to  ask questions if they have any doubt  on the procedure of the first aid in  swimming. If the swimming facility is  available then the life saving technique  of drowning can best be practised by  doing. In the classroom or physical  education laboratory the students may  make use of dummies.  Chapter-12 First Aid & safety indd.indd   179 08-11-2016   11:48:18 AM'},\n",

If such wounds are on more than  20 per cent of the body, then it may be fatal. • \\tA full thickness burn is not painful in most of the cases,  so it may mislead the first‑aider and the casualty about  the severity of the injury. This needs immediate medical  attention. As, the kind of the burns vary, so does the kind of first aid  needed for various kind of burns. (a) First Aid for Severe Burns In this case, the first aid is given to : • stop burning and relieve pain; • treat the associate injuries; • minimise the risk of infection; In case of severe burn the following steps need to be taken. Step 1:  Help the casualty to lie down. Do not allow the injury  area to come into direct contact with the ground. Step 2: \\tPour cold water on the burn for a minimum of 10  minutes, but at the same time, arrangement of  transport for taking the casualty to hospital should  be made. Continue cooling the affected area until the  pain is relieved. Step 3: \\tGently remove any ring, watch, belt and shoes before  the tissues begin to swell. Carefully remove burnt  clothing, if it is not sticking to the skin. Step 4: \\tCover the injured area with a sterile dressing to protect  it from infection.

In case of burn of the face, do not cover  the injury because it may cause discomfort to the  victim. Keep cooling the area till the doctor arrives. (b) First Aid for Mild Burn In case of mild burns, first aid is given to : • stop burning. • relieve pain and swelling. • minimise the risk of infection. In case of mild burns, one should : Step 1: \\tPour cold water on the injured part for minimum 10  minutes, to relieve pain.

(c) First Aid for Injuries on the Play Field Injuries which occur as a result of participation in the sports  activity are known as sports injuries or athletic injuries. There  are various types of sports injuries. These are mentioned in  the following table 12.1. Table 12.1 Injuries Types Skin injuries Abrasion (falling on rough or firm surface) Laceration (tears in the skin) Incision (cut by a sharp edge of an object) Puncture wound (pierced by a sharp and  pointed object) Avulsion (tearing away of a part of the skin) Soft tissue  injuries (e.g.  muscles,  ligaments) Contusion (Bruise caused by the direct  blow to some part of the body. For example:  Knee of a player is knocked against thigh of  the person). Sprain (Injury of ligament of joints, caused  by the violent overstretching of ligament  in a joint or the movement of the joint in  abnormal directions. It is characterised by  pain, tenderness, swelling at the joint. Strain (Injury of muscle or tendon, three  types– mild, moderate, severe). Joint injuries Joint injuries are very common in sports  they are known as joint dislocation. “Dislocation is the displacement of  contiguous surfaces of two or more bones  which are in a joint.” Causes: An external  force which forces the joint to move beyond  the limits of a joint. If the joint is forced  to move in an abnormal direction, this  dislocation can be a complete or a partial  displacement of the bones. Box 12.5 Box 12.6 CALLUSES These are thickening  of the epidermis. It  usually occurs in the  palm of the hands or  on the sole of the foot  due to constant friction  or  pressure.  If  the  calluses crack then it  will cause a very painful  condition. Sometimes  a blister may develop  under the callus. When  it becomes very hard,  to prevent cracking,  soak the body part in  the water for some time  and then scrub it off.  If it gets infected then  consult a doctor. BLISTERS These are caused by  the deposition of a type  of colourless fluid in  between the dermis and  epidermis. Sometimes  this fluid may be blood  stained; this is due  to the damage of the  blood vessels caused  by  the  continuous  frictional force. It is  normally seen on the  hand or palm or on big  toe. Blisters should not  be cut, rather the fluid  inside can be removed  by a sterile syringe, but  only by a doctor. Chapter-12 First Aid & safety indd.indd   181 08-11-2016   11:48:18 AM'},\n",

The fractures can be  open/compound fracture or a closed/simple  fracture. Severity of the fracture varies from  the mild crack in the bone to the severe  shattering of the bone into many pieces.   Prevention Since prevention is better than cure, it then becomes essential  to take appropriate precautions. Make the area in and around  the play field hazard free. In order to prevent injuries proper  warm up is required prior to executing vigorous movements.  Similarly, use of appropriate physical conditioning is essential  to avoid injury. First aid for strains, sprains, contusions is packaged in  the abbreviation RICE which is Rest, Icing, Compression and  Elevation as shown in Box 12.5. Rest • \\tStop using injured part or discontinue activity. It could  cause further injury, delay healing, increase pain and  stimulate bleeding.  • \\tUse crutches to avoid bearing weight on injuries of the  leg, knee, ankle and foot.  • \\tUse splint for injuries of the arm, elbow, wrist and hand.  Ice  • \\tIce application contracts blood vessels.  • \\tHelps stop internal bleeding from injured capillaries and  blood vessels.  • \\tHastens healing time by reducing swelling around injury. • \\tKeep damp or dry cloth between skin and ice pack.  •  Do not apply ice for longer than 15 to 20 minutes at a  time.  • \\tApply every hour for 10 to 20 minutes.  • \\tApply ice as long as pain or inflammation persists.  Compression • \\tHastens healing time by reducing swelling around injury.  •  Decreases seeping of fluid into injured area from adjacent  tissues.  • \\tUse elasticised bandage, compression sleeve, or cloth.  • \\tWrap injured part firmly.  •  Do not impair blood supply.  • \\tToo tight bandage may cause more swelling.  • \\tWrap over ice.  • \\tLoosen the bandage if it gets too tight.

Health is the state of physical,  mental and social well-being. It should be viewed in a holistic  way.  An individual may be physically and mentally healthy,  but if her/his social condition is problematic, she/he cannot  achieve holistic health. In the present chapter, we shall focus  on various aspects of social health. 13.2\\tWhat is Social Health? Let us first understand the meaning of social health. We know  that social health is one of the three major components of  health, the other two being physical and mental. Social health  can be defined in two ways.  In one sense, it refers to the  health of a person with reference to her/his ability to interact  with others. It also refers to the health of a society in general.  It focuses on how the members of a society treat each other  and behave with each other. What kind of social environment  prevails and how the prevailing customs and traditions guide  the behaviour of individuals towards self, each other and  towards the society as a whole also form social health. Social  Health also includes how individual’s natural environment  around them is. The role of the community as a whole acquires  great importance for enhancing and maintaining the quality of  the health of individuals. Although there are many dimensions  of social health, we shall discuss below the impact of social  customs on our health, the need to protect natural resources  and the empowerment of community for healthy living. 13.3\\tImpact of Social Customs  Customs and traditions prevalent in a society influence all  aspects of the lives of individuals, including their health and  welfare. What people eat, how they eat, how they live and care  for their own health as well as the health of their near and dear  ones are influenced by the prevailing customs and traditions.  Let us first understand the meaning of the term custom. 13.3.1 What is a Custom? Customs generally refer to beliefs, habits or actions performed  in the past and transmitted through time from one generation  Social Health 13 Activity 13.1 Make a list of  customs having a  positive and negative  impact on the health  of individual and  society prevailing in  your neighbourhood.

These are derived from social norms which are  rules or standards that guide, control or regulate proper and  acceptable behaviour of a group. These norms define the shared  expectations of a group and enable people to anticipate how  others will interpret and respond to their words and actions  if there is a deviation from these norms. For example, there  are customs and traditions related to marriage ceremonies.  These are observed by not only those who are getting married  but also by the other members of the family and community.  Many of the customs have positive impact on the relationships  in a family and community. However, many of the customs  have negative impact as well. For example, there are customs  prevalent in many communities, like early marriage or  discriminating against female child, or choice of spouse, which  adversely affect the health and well-being not only of the female  child but of the society as a whole.    13.3.2 Customs and Health  In every society, the individuals,  families and communities observe  many customs that have direct  bearing  on  health.  From  the  moment of birth of a child, customs  begin to shape experiences and  behaviour of the child. In reality,  by the time children can think  independently, the health-related  customs of the family have already  become an intimate part of their  personalities. They do not question  these customs, as they are deeply  held and protected by the society.  It becomes extremely difficult to  change them. Let us understand  this by considering what happened  to Seema. The  experiences  of  Seema  shows the negative impact of social  customs on health.  Let us consider the influence  of customs on the thinking and  behaviour of individuals in respect  of early marriage, breastfeeding  practices, family size, preference for  male child and substance abuse. All  these affect family and community  health.   Activity 13.2 Seema studies in Class IX in a small town. She  has two elder brothers.  Both the brothers get a  lot of attention from the parents.  Parents believe  that both their sons should get larger portion  of milk, cheese and eggs. They tell Seema that  her brothers need to be strong as they will grow  up to head their families in future.  On the  other hand, parents tell Seema that she should  eat less, otherwise she will look too grown up  and big for her age.  One day, while in class,  Seema told her teacher that she was feeling  dizzy.  Before the teacher could do anything,  she fainted. The teacher took her to a nearby  hospital and then went home with her. The  teacher told Seema’s parents that the doctor  had said that it was because of anaemia that  she had fainted and that it was very important  to ensure that Seema gets good nutrition to  remain healthy.  Think 1.\\t Do you think the reasons given by  Seema’s parents for ensuring that their  sons get good nutrition while neglecting  Seema’s nutritional needs are justified?  Give reasons. 2.\\t What are the customs related to diet for  girls in your family and community? Chapter-13 Social Health.indd   186 08-11-2016   11:49:40 AM'},\n",

The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1978  stipulates legal age of marriage as 18 for girls and 21 for boys,  but social customs encourage early marriage even now. You may  have heard the word kanyadan. Influenced by  prevailing customs, many parents consider  it good to marry their daughters even before  she attains puberty. The tradition of dowry is  another factor for early marriage in India.  It is  believed that dowry will be lower if the bride is  younger in age.   The early marriage custom puts pressure  on young married women to prove their  fertility resulting in high rates of adolescent  pregnancy. Adolescent pregnancy leads to  greater health risks for the teenage mother  and her child. Biologically, she is yet to attain  reproductive maturity. There are chances of  prolonged labour that can result in severe  damage to the reproductive tract. The available  evidence suggests that maternal deaths  are considerably higher among adolescent  mothers than among mature mothers. The  babies born to adolescent mothers generally  have low birth-weight. Such babies are more  likely to die at birth or in infancy. Early  pregnancy increases the risk of maternal  and child morbidity and mortality. Early  pregnancy also has serious psychological,  social and economic consequences.  It continues to affect adversely the  educational, economic and social  status of women and is likely to  have negative impact on the quality  of life of the family.  In many cases, young girls are  married to older men. Such girls  do not have the courage to take  decisions related to family needs,  lack power and are more likely  to experience partner violence.

Breastfeeding We have seen above the adverse  effects  of  social  customs  promoting early marriage in our  society. But some customs do  have positive impact, for example,  consider the issue related to  breastfeeding. We are aware that  traditionally mothers breastfeed  their infants for a year or two and  sometimes even longer. This has  been an accepted norm. But now- a-days, due to paucity of time  and as a matter of convenience,  some mothers do not breastfeed  their infants. Life style concern  also comes in the way of breast  feeding. They choose to shift to  powdered or bottled milk as a  substitute for breast milk. Today  an increasing number of women  are working outside their homes  and bottle feeding seems to be  considered a more convenient  option for them. Those who  choose to breastfeed are looked  down upon. Breastfeeding in  public is also not an acceptable  option. However,  there  are  two  significant needs, which make  breastfeeding  important  both  for the mother as well as the  child. One is nutritional while  the  other  is  psychological.  While the nutritional benefit of  breastfeeding is no doubt very  important,  the  psychological  bonding which develops between  the child and the mother due  to breastfeeding is unparalleled  and has a positive impact on the  health of both.

Sangeeta was studying in Class IX when her  marriage was fixed with a person twice her age.  Although she wanted to study further, she was  pulled out of school because she was the eldest in  the family and there were three more sisters to be  married off. Soon after marriage, her husband and  in-laws started pressurising her to become pregnant  as they wanted an heir to their family. Sangeeta  was unhappy but she did not have a choice. Within  three months of her marriage, she got pregnant.  Despite not keeping well during the pregnancy, she  was made to do most of the household work. In the  fifth month of her pregnancy, she had a miscarriage  (abortion). Rather than supporting her through this  difficult experience, her in-laws blamed Sangeeta  for not giving them an heir.  Questions for reflection 1.\\t Who all are responsible for Sangeeta’s  condition? 2.\\t If you were in Sangeeta’s situation, What  would you have done? 3.\\t If Sangeeta was a boy, would things have  been different?

              "  'text': 'Social Health\\t 189 There are many reasons why breast milk is healthier.   Breast milk contains more than hundred nutrients that cannot  be prepared in the laboratory. These nutrients are essential for  the healthy growth and development of the child.  In fact, the  caloric density, protein, carbohydrate and fat in breast milk are  very important for the growth of the child.  Breast milk is free  from contamination by bacteria and is easier for the infant’s  stomach to digest.  Infants who are breastfed for at least eight  months have reduced incidence of many diseases. The first  secretion from the mother’s breast after the birth of the infant  is known as colostrum. Scientific studies have shown that it  is extremely good for the new born. But in some communities  the mother is asked not to feed this fluid to the child, as they  ignorantly think it to be impure. Such customs with a negative  impact should be discouraged by creating awareness.   Family Size, Preference for Male Child Another set of customs and tradition that have adverse impact  on social health is related to family size. Many people believe  that child birth is a gift of God and individuals should not  interfere with this divine process.  People also have preference  for male child. Many a time parents go on giving birth to  children, and the size of the family continues to grow, until a  male child is born. This belief contributes to increasing number  of children in the family. Some parents want to have at least  two male children. The preference for male child has been the  main cause of discrimination against girls. Girls are considered  inferior to boys. Owing to discrimination, nutritional needs of  girls are not met adequatly. All food items that are served to  boys are not given to girls or are given in very less quantity.  The girls are also discriminated in availing education facilities.  In the process, girls are married off very early. The discrimination against females has been a grave  problem in our society. You must have read about the inverse  sex ratio being a problem in our country as discused earlier.  Parents get the pregnancy test done in a clinic and if they find  it to be a female foetus, they get it aborted. Many girl children  are killed just after their birth. Substance Abuse You have already studied in detail about substance abuse in  Chapter 2. It is also known as drug abuse which has become a  serious problem in our society.  It is important to note that social customs have been closely  related with the drug or substance abuse related behaviour of  individuals since ages.

There are certain social groups which are  more vulnerable to substance abuse. On the contrary social  customs prescribe that intoxicants should not be taken by  children up to a certain age.  Developments of industrialisation, urbanisation with  consequent migration have resulted in loosening of the  traditional social control on an  individual. Stresses and strains  of modern life, the fast changing  social milieu, among other factors  making people vulnerable to drug  abuse. Moreover, the breaking  of the joint family system, with  limited parental attention and  care in modern families where  both parents are working, peer  pressure, influence of films,   and fashion and values have  led to a considerable rise in the  consumption of drugs, specially  among adolescents.  Substance  abuse  has  a  negative impact on the family and  society. It increases conflicts and  causes untold emotional pain  for every member of the family.  Most of the domestic violence  is directed towards women and  occurs in the context of demands  for money to buy drugs. With  most drug users being in the formative young age, the loss  in terms of human potential is incalculable.

You may be aware that many of our health problems are  caused by environmental degradation. Exposure to air, water  and soil pollution, chemicals in the environment, or noise, can  cause cancer, respiratory, cardiovascular and communicable  diseases, as well as some other serious health disorders.  Although environmental degradation can affect the health of  the whole population, some groups are particularly vulnerable,  including children, pregnant women, the elderly and persons  with pre-existing family history of certain diseases. Recall what  you have learnt in the chapter on water management. As you are aware that number of factors contribute to  environmental degradation, but the most important factor is  the misuse and over use of natural resources.  All that the  nature has provided to us such as soil, air, water, minerals,  sunshine (sunlight), animals and plants, etc., are known  as natural resources. Human beings use these directly or  indirectly for their survival and welfare. The problem lies in  how these natural resources are distributed and used. If at  any time one person or a group of people uses more than their  fair share of resources, an imbalance is created. This leads to  environmental health problems for others. It is, therefore, essential for every individual to ensure  that natural resources are protected and are not misused  or over used, so that social and individual health is not  affected adversely. In India, we have had a great tradition of  environmental conservation. We have been taught since ages to  respect nature and to recognise that all forms of life — human,  animal and plant are closely interrelated. Disturbance in one  gives rise to an imbalance in others. Our Constitution also  has provisions for protection of environment.  13.4.1 Clean Water and Food Resources In view of the above, all the natural resources need to be  protected. It can be done in two ways. Efforts are needed  to ensure that natural resources are used judiciously  according to the needs of the present generation, and of  future generations. Secondly, care needs to be taken so that  natural resources are properly maintained and sustained.  We may take the examples of water and food resources.

Community as  a whole has a very important role to play in ensuring health  of all individuals and for healthy living. In fact, education and  promotion of healthy living and sustainable practices in the  community enhance the quality of life for all. The community  should be educated about living sustainable and healthy life  styles. The one most common denominator in this regard may  be what all we eat and what nutrition we all need to keep  us healthy. It is the one common sustainable practice that  applies to every single one of us, regardless of age, ethnicity,  or economic situation. It is also most important to educate the  community about sustainable and healthy living in a learning  environment.

Adolescents (10–19 years) constitute over  one-fifth of the total population, and their  number is estimated to be about 243  million. They represent a resource for the  future whose potential needs to be nurtured  in a positive manner. The adolescents are  considered to be healthy as a group; however,  they do have a range of health problems that  cause a lot of morbidity as well as mortality.  In spite of specific health problems, it is  a common observation that the existing  health services do not cater to the specific  problems of adolescents. Moreover, it is a  challenge for the health sector to respond to  their needs adequately by offering services  in a friendly manner in a non-threatening environment. In  this chapter, an attempt has been made to discuss the health  needs of adolescents, the status of existing adolescent friendly  health services and the manner in which these services can be  made available to adolescents so that these can be adequately  utilised by them.  14.2\\tHealth Needs of Adolescents As you have realised while going through the chapters ‘Growing  up with Confidence’ and ‘Diet for Healthy Living’, adolescence  is the most significant period in the life of human beings.  It is imperative, therefore, that the needs of adolescents be  recognised and met  adequately. Their health needs are  mentioned below. \\t (i)\\t Nutritional Needs: as discussed in the previous  chapters, many boys and girls enter adolescence  undernourished, making them more vulnerable to  diseases. The findings of the National Family Health  Survey 3 (NFHS 3) indicate high percentage of anaemia  (56 per cent of females and 25 per cent of males in   15–24 age group were anaemic).

Anaemic women are  more prone to give birth to malnourished children, with  significant morbidity and mortality associated with both  mother and child. Adequate nutrition and healthy eating  habits and physical exercise at this age are foundations  for good health in adulthood. \\t (ii)\\t Reproductive and Sexual Health Needs: the adolescents  confront a number of reproductive and sexual health  problems. They hesitate to seek information from  authentic sources as such issues are considered taboo  in our society. There is always a possibility of their  practising risky behaviour, thereby acquiring HIV and  other sexually transmitted infections. According to  National AIDS Control Organisation, almost 50 per cent  of new HIV infections are taking place in 15–24 years  age group (NACO 2005). The adolescent girls suffer due  to a number of myths related to menstruation. Early  marriage is still a serious problem in many parts of  the country. A substantial number of adolescent girls,  mostly married girls, become pregnant and give birth  to children below the legal age of marriage which is 18  years. According to NFHS 3, twelve per cent of married  young women aged 15–19 have become mothers and 4  per cent of women ages 15–19 are currently pregnant  with their first child. This means that one in six women  in the age group.  15–19 years begun child bearing. This  phenomenon of early pregnancy adversely affects the  health of both mothers and children and is the cause of  mortality and morbidity among them.  \\t   \\t  Sexual harassment in public places, institutions   \\t \\t of education, in and around neighbourhood and at the   \\t \\t workplace is a well established fact.

Among 15–19 year olds, suicide is  the second leading cause of death, followed by violence  in the family and community. In fact, effective and  sensitive care of adolescent victims of violence is needed  as one of the priority measures.  \\t (iv)\\t Substance Abuse: tobacco and alcohol use among  young people is emerging as a matter of concern.

Findings of NFHS 3 show that in the age group of 15– 19 years, 3.5 per cent women and 28.6 per cent men  were using some kind of tabacco. Similarly, in this age  group 1 per cent of women and 11 per cent of men were  consuming alcohol. Further, 6.8 per cent women and  18.3 per cent men were drinking about once a week.

Injury rates among adolescents  are the highest. Public education targeted  at young people on how to avoid accidental  injuries during driving and using road,  drowning, burns and falls can reduce  injuries. \\tIn order to address the above needs,  adolescent friendly health services have  been developed. These adolescent friendly  health  services  have  been  designed  specifically to attract them, meet their  needs conveniently and retain them for  continuing care. We have to take note of an  important fact that adolescents are not a  homogeneous group. Their situation varies  with respect to age, sex, marital status, class, region  and cultural context. This calls for interventions that  are flexible and responsive to their needs. 14.3\\tAdolescent Friendly Health Services (AFHS):  What does this mean?

The adolescents feel shy, embarrassed and hesitant in  talking to adults, especially regarding matters that are personal.  Most adolescents avoid seeking care and guidance. They feel  more comfortable in discussing their problems and concerns  with their peers who also do not have scientific knowledge. In  view of this, separate adolescent friendly health services need  to be provided. Such special clinics can take care of all the  concerns of the adolescents in an ambience in which they can  utilise services without any hesitation.  14.5\\tWhy do Adolescents Hesitate in Utilising Health  Services? In additon to some of the reasons cited above, think of the  reasons as to why the adolescents do not avail the health  services. In fact, they face constraints in seeking services due  to barriers such as:  \\t (i)\\t Myths and misconceptions related to the development  of sexual and reproductive organs. \\t (ii)\\t Lack of knowledge of the location of the health services  or the kinds of services offered by them. \\t (iii)\\t Adolescents are not able to go to clinics as their timings  do not match their schedule. They cannot miss school  and college classes to visit these clinics.  \\t (iv)\\t Lack of privacy and confidentiality in health clinics. \\t (v)\\t Long waiting period in the public health clinics. \\t (vi)\\t Cannot afford the fees of the private set up.  \\t (vii)\\t No transport or means to go to these clinics, specially in  rural areas. Moreover, they are unable to afford the cost  of visiting these clinics. \\t(viii)\\t Negative attitudes or judgemental behaviour of nurse/ doctor.  \\t (ix)\\t The routine hospitals do not entertain adolescents  coming alone, especially when they have issues  regarding sexual and reproductive health. Most  hospitals require the parent to accompany them and/ or to give permission for any procedure or testing as per  the legal requirement.  14.6\\tWhere are AFHS Located? Adolescent Friendly Health Services are located at various  places, in hospitals and health centres or at other places.  There are three major models of the location of such services:   Fixed Site Models 1.\\t Hospitals, both public and private in urban areas.  2.\\t Clinics and Health centres in cities. Activity 14.2 Visit an Adolescent  Friendly Health  Service Centre.  Discuss with  the  nurse/doctor  the myths and   misconceptions  usually experienced  by adolescents.

In case you or any of your friends has any  problem or is concerned about any issue, you should visit the  AFHS centre and discuss the same with the nurse or doctor  available. The staff has now been adequately trained to handle  adolescence issues through discussion and counselling. The  staff of adolescent friendly health centres is expected to:  •\\t \\tShow respect for adolescents: the staff need to be non- judgmental and non-critical of the issues an adolescent  comes to the clinic with, including issues regarding  sexual and reproductive health. • \\tKnow importance of privacy and confidentiality:  the trained staff should provide privacy in physical  examination without any embarrassment. The doctors,  nurses and other staff should not divulge information  about the adolescent patient to the parents or  acquaintances, about what they came to the clinic for.  They will need to tell parents only after informing the  adolescent about the legal need or in view of protecting  life and health of the adolescent.

The secondary goal of this program is to introduce more advanced  and specialized intensity techniques to recruit a larger spectrum of muscle fibers  and focus on weak point development. It’s difficult to pin down exactly what  “intermediate-advanced” means in terms of a specific training age due to the fact  that training years in the gym are not equal across individuals. For example, some  folks may have spent 10 years training in the gym, but that time may only actually be  “worth” 1 or 2 years if they’ve spent the majority of their time pumping and going  through the motions without focus or direction. But as a general guide, if you’ve  been training for roughly 2-5 years, with a generally serious approach toward your  training sessions, you will benefit from this program.

This program is intended to build on my Push Pull Legs Hypertrophy Program but  you can still run this program without having run the PPL program first. You can also  run these in “reverse order” where you run the upper/lower program first and then  run the PPL program after.  Before we dive into the nuts and bolts of the program itself, I want to first make it  clear what this training manual is intended to accomplish. As I’ll allude to throughout  the document, this program is only comprised of a single training block lasting 9  weeks. Because wave-loading is used as the main progression model, there is no  formal deload included, however, fatigue will be managed by “waving” efforts in the  gym (where Weeks 1, 4 and 7 serve as “mini-deload weeks”). We will be using three  separate 3-week waves: Week 1 will feel relatively easy, Week 2 will be a bit harder  and Week 3 will be quite challenging. Then in Week 4, efforts will be lower again  and we will build back up from there over the next 3 weeks. This is what is meant by  “waving”.  As you get more and more advanced, progress becomes more and more difficult to  achieve. To break through sticking points in progression, this routine focuses heavily  on training variables like advanced intensity techniques, specific form cues, mind- muscle connection and recovery management.  WHAT THIS PROGRAM ISN’T If you’ve been in the gym for less than 2 years, I’d recommend running through my  Fundamentals Program at least once before advancing to this routine to ensure'},\n",

Functional anatomy determines what muscles can do. There are two things to  consider when looking at a muscle’s functional anatomy – origin and insertion.  Muscles attach to bone by tendons from at least two points. The origin is the fixed  attachment which does not move and the insertion is the attachment which moves  closer to the origin when a muscle contracts. This contracting phase, referred to as  the concentric phase (known as the “positive” phase), is normally followed by the  eccentric phase (lowering the weight – also known as the “negative” phase).'},\n",

The gluteus maximus has multiple origins including the  pelvis, sacrum, coccyx, and thoracolumbar fascia and multiple insertions including  the upper femur and IT band. Because of this, it is able to perform a wide variety of  functions, but primarily: \\t - Hip extension (push your hips forward) \\t - Hip abduction (move your thigh away from the midline) \\t - Hip external rotation (rotating your thigh bone outwards) \\t - Posterior pelvic tilt (tucking your butt “in”)  The smaller glute medius still occupies a hefty portion of the rear hip musculature  and functions primarily as a stabilizer during dynamic movement and as a hip  abductor. It originates on the pelvis and inserts on the femur. It is most effectively  trained with exercises that require a high degree of stability, especially unilateral  movements such as walking lunges, and exercises that train hip abduction, such as  machine hip abductions.

The latissimus dorsi (lats for  short) is a big muscle which  runs from just underneath  your arm pit all the way  down to the bottom of your  back. The lats primarily act to  extend the shoulder (bring  your upper arm downward)  and adduct the shoulder  (moving your elbows  towards your mid back). The trapezius (traps for  short), is another large  muscle running from the  base of the skull down to the  middle of your inner back.  When people think about  the traps, they tend to only  think of the upper fibers, but the middle and lower fibers take up a very large surface  area as well.

It can be difficult to accurately  determine if you are making visual progress day-to-day or even week-to-week.  Taking physique progress photos every 4-6 weeks and comparing them side by  side is a good way to detect visual differences that you simply wouldn’t notice in the  mirror. But ultimately, because of the relationship between strength gain and muscle  gain, the main metric I want you to use for tracking your progress is strength. If  you’re getting stronger, you’re progressing. It is strongly recommended to log every  workout either in writing (print the program out or use a separate notebook) or in an  app, so you don’t have to rely on memory to keep track of personal strength records.  Taking body measurements a few times a year can also be helpful (arms, thigh, waist,  neck) but simply focusing on steady strength progression will be your best proxy for  determining muscular progress.

              "  'text': 'JEFF NIPPARD’S - UPPER/LOWER SIZE AND STRENGTH PROGRAM 25 2: \\tHow much muscle can I expect to gain? A: \\tHow you respond to training will be largely determined by genetic factors and  your specific training history (i.e. How close your are to your genetic “limit”.) As  a rough ballpark estimate for early intermediates with about 1-2 years of lifting  experience, you can expect to gain roughly 0.5-1 lbs of muscle per month (6-12 lbs  of muscle gained in your second year). For intermediate-advanced trainees, 0.25-0.5  lbs of muscle gain per month is reasonable (3-6 lbs of muscle gained per year). For  practical purposes, women can divide muscle gain estimates in half.    3: \\tWhat gym equipment should I use? A: \\tGym equipment is optional as there are no required pieces of equipment to gain  muscle and increase strength. With that being said, investing in an 10mm prong or  lever belt, knee sleeves, squat shoes, and straps can be beneficial in allowing you to  lift more weight for certain exercises. You can find all of my recommended equipment at the following link: http://Rise.ca/jeff  4: \\tI have a belt. When should I wear it? A: \\tOptionally use a lifting belt for working sets on exercises like squats, deadlifts and  overhead (military) presses. Strength is a specific skill, so practice every rep in exactly  the same way (meaning, if you’re going to use a belt at all, use it consistently and for  the same movements). I wouldn’t recommend wearing on a belt on light warm-up  sets. 5: \\tI am not getting sore from my workouts. Is the program not working? A: \\tMuscle soreness is largely attributed to eccentric contractions [1] and long  muscle length contractions [2]. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) isn’t'},\n",

With that said, the main goal of the program is to\\xa0increase  strength and size, not to get you feeling sore. In fact, reduced soreness over time  indicates that your body is adapting and recovering, which is actually a good thing  for continued progress.  6: I am getting very sore from my workouts. Should I skip the gym until I am not  sore? A: \\tYou may experience increased soreness when you first begin the program  because it is presenting a new stress to your body. Foam rolling can help reduce  DOMS [4] and increase ROM [5], so if you are consistently getting sore week after  week, consider adding a short 3-5 minute foam rolling routine at the end of the  workouts. Otherwise, training while sore is not inherently problematic for muscle  growth unless it puts you at an increased risk of injury. If you’re having a difficult  time getting into position for any of the planned exercises, or finding it difficult  to complete a full ROM due to pain, do not train. Otherwise, in the case of mild  soreness, perform a slightly longer warm up for each exercise and use your own  discretion with avoiding injury being a top priority. One extra rest day will not set you  back very far, but a serious injury will.  7: Should I eat in a caloric deficit, maintenance, or surplus while running this  program?  A:\\t Eating in a slight caloric surplus will yield the best results and best recovery,  however, if your main goal is fat loss, eating in a caloric deficit will be necessary.  As a beginner, you can continue to make strength and size progress while in a  moderate caloric deficit and achieve body recomposition (lose fat and build muscle  at the same time) if protein intake is sufficient (0.8-1g/lb bodyweight as a ballpark).  As an intermediate-advanced level trainee, the likelihood of achieving substantial  body recomposition is smaller, but still possible. So, in all, a caloric surplus is'},\n",

Can I add to it? A: \\tYou can add warm-up exercises to the protocol but your warm-up shouldn’t take  any longer than 10-20 minutes. It is important to stay injury-free, so don’t rush into  your workout. 9. \\tWhy is there such little exercise variation from week to week?  A: \\tChanging exercises from week to week is more likely to flatten out the  strength progression curve. This is to ensure both progression by adding volume  incrementally to these specific movements and mastery of these movements in terms  of form and technique. There is exercise variation in exercise selection between  Waves 1, 2 and 3 to avoid monotony and create a novel training stimulus.   10. Isn’t this too much volume?

If you can only train 5 days per week, I  would recommend skipping day 5 and instead running the program as: Day 2, Day  1, Day 4, Day 3, Day 6 which will still allow you to hit your upper body 3x per week  and lower body 2x per week while recovering sufficiently between sessions.

The main purpose behind warming up is to  increase core body temperature, which improves performance and reduces  risk of injury [6] [7]. Your circadian rhythm will largely determine your core body  temperature, meaning it varies throughout the day. When you wake up, your core  temperature is at its lowest and it increases throughout the day. There seems to be  a “sweet spot” for core body temperature in terms of safety and performance, so try  not to train too hot or too cold. Generally speaking, breaking a light sweat through  some form of cardio activity/machine is a good idea before jumping into any heavy  lifting. Doing at least 5-10 minutes of low-moderate intensity cardio is especially  prudent if you train early in the morning [8].  Warm-ups may also serve as a way to increase muscle activation. Dynamic warm- up drills (active stretches that take joints through a range of motion) can improve  WARM UP'},\n",

Don’t simply “go through the motions.” The goal  is to always be very mindful about what muscles are contracting and what movement  that contraction is creating. Lastly, foam rolling has been shown to reduce DOMS (delayed onset muscle  soreness) [4] and brief foam rolling with a specific focus on “tight areas” before a  session can both improve range of motion [10] and prevent injury [11]. Light foam  rolling for 2-3 minutes prior to lifting is recommended. Before the first exercise for each bodypart perform a basic loading pyramid: \\t - Pyramid up in weight with 3-4 light sets, getting progressively heavier \\t - Such a warm up is only required for Primary Exercises  \\t - For example, if you were working up to 4 sets of 350 lbs for 5 reps on the squat, \\t\\t \\t you could warm up as follows:  \\t \\t • Bar (45 lbs) x 15 reps  \\t \\t • 135 lbs x 5 reps  \\t \\t • 225 lbs x 4 reps  \\t \\t • 275 lbs x 3 reps  \\t \\t • 315 lbs x 2 reps  \\t \\t • Then begin working sets with 350 lbs for 5 reps \\t - On a %1RM basis, warm up pyramids can be structured like this:  \\t \\t • Bar (45 lbs) x 15 reps  \\t \\t • 40% lbs x 5 reps  \\t \\t • 50% lbs x 4 reps  \\t \\t • 60% lbs x 3 reps  \\t \\t • 70-75% lbs x 2 reps  \\t \\t • Begin working sets \\t - Note: Remember that such an extensive warm up is only required for Primary \\t \\t \\t   Exercises.'},\n",

Because research suggests  that you should train reasonably close to failure to activate a full spectrum of motor  units and maximize hypertrophy, it is important that we take sets adequately close  to failure in this program. In fact, some exercises will have you pushing beyond the  typical failure point through the use of specialized intensity techniques. Granted,  because high effort training can take a toll on one’s ability to recover properly, it is  important to manage effort appropriately from week to week. For this reason, we  are “waving” effort in 3 week minicycles. Week 1 will function as a mini-deload and  intensity increases in Weeks 2 and 3 before returning to baseline in Week 4.  It is important that proper technique and good lifting habits are established in Week  1 so they can be carried through the remainder of the program. For this reason,  weights in Week 1 may feel a bit lighter than what you’re used to, but will build'},\n",

There are also adjustable bodypart weak point exercises included in the program  so you can prioritize and develop your specific weak areas. I personally plan on  adding additional volume for my biceps and neck on the upper body days and  additional volume for my calves on lower body days. Before starting the program, I’d  recommend choosing 2 or 3 bodyparts and be consistent with training them as your  “weak points” so you aren’t tempted to train muscles you simply enjoy training more  part way through. Also, to be totally clear, you are NOT doing all exercises in one  day, you are simply choosing one exercise for one body part and doing 2 or 3 sets  for that exercise, as indicated in the program.  PROGRESSION This program follows a double progression scheme for primary exercises. This means  that you will be adding one rep from session to session until you reach a certain rep  threshold in Week 3. In Week 4 you will return to the lower end of the rep range with  a weight increase. Generally we will be adding 2.5% 1RM each wave, which may  feel like a conservative increase, however, if you were to run this program over the  entire year, it would result in 85 lbs being added to each lift in a moderate-heavy rep  range! That would translate to enormous 1 rep max gains. Once you get past the  “newbie phase” continued progression really becomes a balancing act of continuing  to make steady progress without risking an overtraining episode or injury. My best  word of advice when it comes to progressing on this program is this: take it slow and  steady with the primary compound lifts while keeping your form 100% and use the  secondary and tertiary exercises to push yourself harder and have some fun.

Still, this  shouldn’t be an excuse to treat training as a bore: simply going through the motions.  Rather, you should be putting extra emphasis on technique mastery, mind-muscle  connection and acclimating yourself to new exercises and intensity techniques.     WHY IS TECHNIQUE SO IMPORTANT? The progressive overload principle should be thought of as not just adding  more weight to the bar, but adding more tension onto the muscle itself. Dr. Brad  Schoenfeld refers to this as the mechanical tension mechanism of hypertrophy [12].  “Overloading” a movement by allowing form to break down does not necessarily  imply that more tension has been added to the muscle since the use of excessive  momentum and the involvement of assisting muscles can help “move the weight”.  So, while I think it is acceptable to allow for controlled “cheating” on some secondary  and tertiary exercises, primary exercises should be purposefully mastered and  controlled on every single rep. There are two main reasons for this: safety and results. 1.) SAFETY Strength training can be dangerous. A questionnaire of Swedish sub-elite  powerlifters found that 87% of the participants had experienced an injury within  the past year [13] – primarily in the lumbopelvic, shoulder, and anterior hip regions.  Since building muscle and increasing strength is a time-consuming process,  it’s important to stay as healthy as possible for as long as possible. Consistently  practicing perfect technique on light work will ensure that you have engrained the  proper lifting habits when lifting the really heavy stuff.'},\n",

RESULTS Not only does good technique minimize injury risk, it also loads the targeted  muscles more effectively, while decreasing the loading of synergistic and stabilizing  muscles [14]. A large degree of strength development is directly tied to technique  development and because of the primacy of the progressive overload principle, it’s  safe to say that a focus on getting stronger in the rep zones included in this program  will lead to greater muscle gains. This all begins with good technique.  HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE “GOOD FORM”? Some trainers take the extreme stance that zero momentum or cheating should be  used when lifting, regardless of how well controlled the cheating is. Others insist  that because the goal is to overload, cheating is fine since it allows you to move  more weight. I think they are both wrong, because it is always context dependent  and in this case, exercise dependent: Primary Exercises: Practice perfect technique on all reps (for example, squats, bench  presses and deadlifts). Secondary and Tertiary Exercises: Mild momentum is permitted to get the weight  moving, but always control the weight on the eccentric.  Exactly what constitutes “good form” will depend on the specific exercise being  performed and the person performing the exercise. Still, a helpful practice is to  record your lifts and compare your technique to the technique demonstrated in  the videos provided (page 79). You can also have a more experienced friend or  coach give you feedback while keeping in mind that you should “feel exercises” in  the muscle, not in tendons or ligaments.

This is an important concern  for safety reasons, however some literature suggests that the eccentric (negative)  portion of the lift is the most important for muscle growth. A 2015 meta-analysis  by Schoenfeld, Ogborn, & Krieger found that rep durations between 0.5-8 sec all  lead to similar amounts of hypertrophy [15]. This suggests that you should choose  a tempo that is comfortable for you, while maintaining full control of the weight  throughout the entire repetition. My personal recommendation is to aim for a 1-2  second negative and a 1-2 second positive on most lifts, with the main criteria  being that you are consciously and actively controlling the weight using the target  muscles throughout the full range of motion. For primary lifts like bench presses  and squats, you should aim for a more “explosive” concentric and focus more on the  movement of your entire body in three-dimensional space, rather than on a specific  lifting tempo. Deadlifts are the one possible exception where the eccentric does  not need to be controlled to the same degree – simply hold the bar on its way down'},\n",

This basic habit across all exercises will allow for a more efficient  understanding of the movement pattern and ensure roughly equal strength abilities  at all points throughout the movement’s range of motion. From a safety perspective, it’s also important to note that a full range of motion will  usually require the use of lighter weights. Using the bench press as an example,  you will be able to lift much more weight if only bring the bar half way to your chest  than you will by bringing the bar all the way down to touch your chest. This “extra  weight” on the bar may cause additional stress on the joints and soft-tissues without  any additional benefit in terms of hypertrophy. This was highlighted in a 2013 study  by Bloomquist and colleagues, which found that going through a full range of  motion resulted in greater increases in muscle mass than using a partial range of  motion [17]. Granted, there is counter-evidence supporting the idea that as long as  intensity (relative effort) is equated, full and partial ranges of motions lead to similar  hypertrophy [18, 19] 3.\\tPROPER BREATHING  Knowing how to breathe during a lift is something many lifters struggle with.

My simple recommendation is to inhale during the eccentric (negative) and exhale  during the concentric (positive). This may feel awkward at first so I recommend  paying close attention to your breathing during your warm up sets so that you  can better “engrain” those proper breathing habits for your heavier sets. If your  temptation is to hold your breath while lifting, consciously remind yourself to breathe  and consider “marking the breath” by saying to yourself “breathing in” as you lower  the weight and “breathing out” as you lift the weight back up.  In addition to ensuring proper oxygenation, research has shown that inhaling  during the eccentric portion of the lift and exhaling during the concentric portion  significantly lessens the increase in blood pressure associated with the more  advanced “Valsalva maneuver” technique. [20, 21]. The Valsalva technique is when  you forcibly exhale against a closed glottis during the concentric portion of a lift.  This is a very commonly used technique amongst powerlifters and other strength  athletes to increase the amount of weight being lifted by increasing pressure in  the abdomen. In the intermediate-advanced stage of lifting, I would recommend  experimenting with the Valsalva maneuver on primary exercises (squat, bench press  and deadlift) to your own comfort levels since it will very likely help increase the  weight you are using on these exercises. However, keep in mind that this breathing  technique is associated with a greater increase in blood pressure, so use it at your  own discretion and be particularly cautious if you are at risk of hypertension.

As usually is  the case, I think that the answer is not black and white and depends on context.  Generally speaking, the mind muscle connection should only be used sparingly (if  at all) on primary exercises like squats, deadlifts and overhead presses as these are  highly technique-focused exercises that will activate a large muscle mass regardless  of attentional focus. For these movements, it is better to focus on the movement  of your entire body and simply execute the exercise with proper technique and  through a full range of motion. For all tertiary exercises (isolation exercises) and  any remaining compound exercises, you can use the mind-muscle connection to  increase activation of the target muscle as you feel appropriate. For the record,  research has shown increased muscle activation when subjects are instructed to  use “internal cueing” (such as squeezing your glutes as hard as possible to get the  barbell to move in a hip thrust) as opposed to “external cueing” (such as simply  moving the barbell upwards) [22]. And recent data has suggested that use of a  mind-muscle connection can be used to enhance muscle hypertrophy. So while it  may not be appropriate for all exercises, practicing and cultivating a strong mind  muscle connection is well-advised if your goal is to achieve the best muscular  development possible.  In summary, our goal with training is to maximize muscular tension with relatively  large training volumes and as outlined above, the best way to do that is by honing in  on your technique.'},\n",

One potential limitation of training frequency research is that studies  are always volume equated, so the subjects are actually doing the same amount  of total work. In the real world, it is less likely that volumes would be equal when  frequencies are different. Higher frequency training typically allows us to do more  volume within a week.

EFFORT/INTENSITY HOW HARD SHOULD YOU PUSH EACH SET?  This program uses both percentage-based and RPE-based methods for determining  what weights you should use, which will ultimately determine your level of effort.  %1RM BASED EXERCISES Loads for primary exercises (squat, bench press, deadlift) are determined based on a  percentage of your 1 rep max (1RM) for that exercise. The main advantage of using a  %1RM approach is that progression is ensured in an objective manner week to week.  Nothing is left up to how you’re feeling that day – there is a set weight prescribed in  the program, and it’s your responsibility to hit it.

This program uses RPE to gauge effort for all  secondary and tertiary exercises. The RPE scale is ranked from 1-10, with 1 implying  nearly no effort was used, and 10 implying maximal effort was achieved (training to  failure) [26]. I think this can be more easily conceptualized as RPE9 meaning work  at about 90% of your maximal effort, RPE8 bring about 80% of maximal effort, etc.  Another way to think about RPE is as the inverse of “reps in reserve” (RIR). RIR is  a scale which attempts to gauge how many additional reps you would be able to  complete after ending the set [27]. While research has shown that RIR is not very  accurate for newer lifters [28], I think it is a good tool to understand at this point  in your training career. So, to clarify, an RPE of 9 would mean you had 1 rep left in  reserve. An RPE of 8 would mean you had 2 reps in reverse, etc.  In the program, the last set RPE column (LSRPE) is left blank for you to fill in. The idea  here is to reflect on your last set and ask yourself how many more reps you think you  could have gotten. It is a useful way to account for how hard you’re working on the  final set and how well it matches the target RPE.  AN IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ABOUT TRAINING INTENSITY (EFFORT) While I admire a strong work ethic, similar to volume, more effort is not always better.  Properly applied effort is what we are always looking for. This means that we should  reserve training to failure (or near failure) for when it fits within the context of the  program as a whole.

Don’t be tempted to push yourself too hard in these sessions  as they are intended to lay the foundation for the upcoming wave’s progression.  VOLUME: Volume loosely refers to the total amount of work you’re doing. This is often  approximated as sets x reps x load, but is often simply thought of as the total  number of sets. Total volume can be viewed as both volume per-session and  volume per-week. Per-session volume requirements are actually quite low, with the  research showing just one single set to be an adequate stimulus for hypertrophy,  [29] however, multiple sets (3-5 sets) per muscle group are thought to be required  to maximize hypertrophy [30]. It is important to remember that not all volume is  created equally and more volume isn’t always the answer. A study comparing 5 sets  of 10 reps versus 10 sets of 10 reps on the squat actually showed greater strength  responses in the 5 sets group, despite using half the volume. Additionally, the 10 x  10 group lost muscle (on average) in their legs [31], so there appears to be a volume  limit past which more volume is not helpful for hypertrophy. When it comes to per-week volume, James Krieger recommends an absolute  minimum of 10 sets per week per muscle group [32], with 10-20 sets per bodypart  per week being a good ballpark estimate for intermediate-advanced trainees.  Because of the large degree of overlap between bodyparts on compound exercises,  tracking set volume per bodypart has its complications and limitations. For this  reason, we will be measuring total sets per workout. We will lump all of the upper  body and all of the lower body muscles together and calculate total per-session  volume, which I think is a more practical way to keep track of volume on this routine.  These numbers will be instructive for you when moving on to further blocks of  training or other programs so that you can have an idea of how your body responds  to the per-session “upper body volume” and “lower body volume” laid out in this  routine.'},\n",

              "  'text': 'JEFF NIPPARD’S - UPPER/LOWER SIZE AND STRENGTH PROGRAM 73 AN IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ABOUT TRAINING VOLUME If you’re coming to this program from a background of super high volume training,  hopefully this routine will help you find the balance you need for a long and  prosperous training career. Try to keep in mind that volume accumulates throughout  each wave in a structured manner and throughout the program, our number one  priority is quality of execution.  Just because someone may be running a higher volume training program than you  does not imply that they will see better results. This is because there are so many  factors other than volume that go into proper program design, so it is careless  and shortsighted to judge a program based merely on how many sets it has you  doing. Granted, volume has been identified as one of the primary factors driving  muscle growth, so it must still be considered a central tenet of program design.  However, this shouldn’t tempt us to fall for either of the two most common volume  misconceptions:  1. The “Pedestal Myth”: the false idea that volume matters more than everything else.  The reality is that ALL program variables must fit together like a puzzle, and it would  be inappropriate to put one variable on a pedestal.  2. The “Quantity-Over-Quality Myth”: the false idea that more volume is always  better. Like the rest of the training variables, volume must be properly managed  within the training week and compliment the other, more foundational programming  factors like proper exercise execution (technique), the prioritization of recovery and  the management of effort.

The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances  required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must  be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not  synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three  basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure,  and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic  functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental  surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and  reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body  to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates,  lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain  non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common  in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or  beneficial (such as antioxidants).  4  |  Introduction'},\n",

There are three classes of macronutrients:  carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically  processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients  comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is  converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,  allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of  measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels  the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie  multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories,  denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a  capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in  the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other  macronutrients, it does not yield calories.  Carbohydrates  Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and  oxygen. The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk,  fruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes. Non-starchy vegetables  also contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates  are broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical  structure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and  complex carbohydrates.  Simple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples  of simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have  in a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that  circulates in your blood.  Complex carbohydrates are long chains of simple sugars that can  be unbranched or branched. During digestion, the body breaks  Introduction  |  5'},\n",

Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is  stored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber  is also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by  digestive enzymes in the human intestine. As a result, it passes  through the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that  inhabit the colon or large intestine break it down.  One gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of  energy for the cells in the body to perform work. In addition to  providing energy and serving as building blocks for bigger  macromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning  of the nervous system, heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose  can be stored in the body for future use. In humans, the storage  molecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is  known as starch. Glycogen and starch are complex carbohydrates.  Lipids  Lipids are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen,  and oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water.  Lipids are found predominantly in butter, oils, meats, dairy  products, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods. The three  main  types  of  lipids  are  triglycerides  (triacylglycerols),  phospholipids, and sterols. The main job of lipids is to provide or  store energy. Lipids provide more energy per gram than  carbohydrates (nine kilocalories per gram of lipids versus four  kilocalories per gram of carbohydrates). In addition to energy  storage, lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes,  surround and protect organs (in fat-storing tissues), provide  insulation to aid in temperature regulation, and regulate many other  functions in the body.  6  |  Introduction'},\n",

Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon,  oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include  meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant- based foods, most notably soy.

Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two  hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water. More than 60  percent of your total body weight is water. Without it, nothing could  be transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not  occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would  fluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters  of water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so  critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and  output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in  Chapter 4.  Micronutrients  Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser  amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions.  Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins.  There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See  Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2  “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their  major functions). In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins,  micronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist  in the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e.,  coenzymes). Enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions  in the body and are involved in all aspects of body functions from  producing  energy,  to  digesting  nutrients,  to  building  macromolecules.

To date, science has not been able to track the  exact path in the brain that occurs in response to eating a particular  food, but it is quite clear that foods, in general, stimulate emotional  responses in people. Food also has psychological, cultural, and  religious significance, so your personal choices of food affect your  mind, as well as your body. The social implications of food have a  great deal to do with what people eat, as well as how and when.  Special events in individual lives—from birthdays to funerals—are  commemorated with equally special foods. Being aware of these  forces can help people make healthier food choices—and still honor  the traditions and ties they hold dear.  Typically, eating kosher food means a person is Jewish; eating  fish on Fridays during Lent means a person is Catholic; fasting  during the ninth month of the Islamic calendar means a person  is Muslim. On New Year’s Day, Japanese take part in an annual  tradition of Mochitsuki also known as Mochi pounding in hopes  of gaining good fortune over the coming year.

Some foods that  are very healthy, such as tofu, may be unappealing at first to  many people. However, creative cooks can adapt healthy foods  to meet most people’s taste.  • Economics. Access to fresh fruits and vegetables may be scant,  particularly for those who live in economically disadvantaged  or remote areas, where cheaper food options are limited to  convenience stores and fast food.  • Early food experiences. People who were not exposed to  different foods as children, or who were forced to swallow  every last bite of overcooked vegetables, may make limited  food choices as adults.  • Habits. It’s common to establish eating routines, which can  work both for and against optimal health. Habitually grabbing a  fast food sandwich for breakfast can seem convenient, but  might not offer substantial nutrition. Yet getting in the habit of  drinking an ample amount of water each day can yield multiple  benefits.  • Culture. The culture in which one grows up affects how one  sees food in daily life and on special occasions.  • Geography. Where a person lives influences food choices. For  instance, people who live in Midwestern US states have less  access to seafood than those living along the coasts.  • Advertising. The media greatly influences food choice by  persuading consumers to eat certain foods.  • Social factors.

In addition, people who have never worried  about their weight have a very different approach to eating  than those who have long struggled with excess weight.  • Emotions. There is a wide range in how emotional issues affect  eating habits. When faced with a great deal of stress, some  people tend to overeat, while others find it hard to eat at all.  • Green food/Sustainability choices. Based on a growing  understanding of diet as a public and personal issue, more and  more people are starting to make food choices based on their  environmental impact. Realizing that their food choices help  shape the world, many individuals are opting for a vegetarian  diet, or, if they do eat animal products, striving to find the  most “cruelty-free” options possible. Purchasing local and  organic food products and items grown through sustainable  processes also helps shrink the size of one’s dietary footprint.  People choose a vegetarian diet for various reasons, including  religious doctrines, health concerns, ecological and animal welfare  concerns, or simply because they dislike the taste of meat. There  are different types of vegetarians, but a common theme is that  vegetarians do not eat meat. Four common forms of vegetarianism  are:  1. Lacto-ovo vegetarian. This is the most common form.

There are five key factors that make  up a healthful diet:  1. A diet must be adequate, by providing sufficient amounts of  each essential nutrient, as well as fiber and adequate calories.  2. A balanced diet results when you do not consume one nutrient  at the expense of another, but rather get appropriate amounts  of all nutrients.  3. Calorie control is necessary so that the amount of energy you  get from the nutrients you consume equals the amount of  energy you expend during your day’s activities.  4. Moderation means not eating to the extremes, neither too  much nor too little.  5. Variety refers to consuming different foods from within each  of the food groups on a regular basis.  A healthy diet is one that favors whole foods. As an alternative  to modern processed foods, a healthy diet focuses on “real” fresh  whole foods that have been sustaining people for generations.  Whole foods supply the needed vitamins, minerals, protein,  carbohydrates, fats, and fiber that are essential to good health.  Commercially prepared and fast foods are often lacking nutrients  and often contain inordinate amounts of sugar, salt, saturated and  trans fats, all of which are associated with the development of  diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, cancer,  obesity, diabetes, and other illnesses. A balanced diet is a mix of food  from the different food groups (vegetables, legumes, fruits, grains,  protein foods, and dairy).  30  |  Achieving a Healthy Diet'},\n",

Nutrient-dense foods are the opposite of  “empty-calorie” foods, such as sugary carbonated beverages, which  are also called “nutrient-poor.” Nutrient-dense foods include fruits  and vegetables, lean meats, poultry, fish, low-fat dairy products, and  whole grains. Choosing more nutrient-dense foods will facilitate  weight loss, while simultaneously providing all necessary nutrients.  Balance  Balance the foods in your diet. Achieving balance in your diet entails  not consuming one nutrient at the expense of another. For example,  calcium is essential for healthy teeth and bones, but too much  calcium will interfere with iron absorption. Most foods that are  good sources of iron are poor sources of calcium, so in order to  get the necessary amounts of calcium and iron from your diet, a  proper balance between food choices is critical. Another example  is that while sodium is an essential nutrient, excessive intake may  contribute to congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease  in some people. Remember, everything must be consumed in the  proper amounts.  Moderation  Eat in moderation. Moderation is crucial for optimal health and  survival. Eating nutrient-poor foods each night for dinner will lead  to health complications.

Monitor food portions. For optimum weight maintenance, it is  important to ensure that energy consumed from foods meets the  energy expenditures required for body functions and activity. If not,  the excess energy contributes to gradual, steady accumulation of  stored body fat and weight gain. In order to lose body fat, you need  to ensure that more calories are burned than consumed. Likewise,  in order to gain weight, calories must be eaten in excess of what is  expended daily.  Variety  Variety involves eating different foods from all the food groups.  Eating a varied diet helps to ensure that you consume and absorb  adequate amounts of all essential nutrients required for health. One  of the major drawbacks of a monotonous diet is the risk of  consuming too much of some nutrients and not enough of others.  Trying new foods can also be a source of pleasure—you never know  what foods you might like until you try them.  Developing a healthful diet can be rewarding, but be mindful that  all of the principles presented must be followed to derive maximal  health benefits. For instance, introducing variety in your diet can  still result in the consumption of too many high-calorie, nutrient  poor foods and inadequate nutrient intake if you do not also employ  moderation and calorie control. Using all of these principles  together will promote lasting health benefits.  32  |  Achieving a Healthy Diet'},\n",

To carry out  this isolation, he burned some seaweed and in the process, observed  an intense violet vapor that crystallized when he exposed it to a cold  surface. He sent the violet crystals to an expert on gases, Joseph  Gay-Lussac, who identified the crystal as a new element. It was  named iodine, the Greek word for violet. The following scientific  record is some of what took place in order to conclude that iodine  is a nutrient.  Observation. Eating seaweed is a cure for goiter, a gross  enlargement of the thyroid gland in the neck.  Hypothesis.

Career Connection  What are some of the ways in which you think like a  scientist, and use the scientific method in your everyday  life? Any decision-making process uses some aspect of the  scientific method. Think about some of the major decisions  you have made in your life and the research you conducted  that supported your decision. For example, what brand of  computer do you own? Where is your money invested?  What college do you attend?  Evidence-Based Approach to Nutrition  It took more than one hundred years from iodine’s discovery as  an effective treatment for goiter until public health programs  recognized it as such. Although a lengthy process, the scientific  method is a productive way to define essential nutrients and  determine their ability to promote health and prevent disease.

Genes are part of DNA and contain the genetic  information that make up all of our traits. Genes are codes for  proteins and when they are turned “on” or “off,” they change how  the body works. While we know that health is defined as more than  just the absence of disease, there are currently very few accurate  genetic markers of good health. Rather, there are many more  genetic markers for disease. However, science is evolving, and  nutritional genetics aims to identify what nutrients to eat to “turn  on” healthy genes and “turn off” genes that cause disease.

The scientific study under discussion should be published in a  peer reviewed journal, such as the Journal of Nutrition.  Question studies that come from less trustworthy sources  (such as non peer-reviewed journals or websites) or that are  not formally published.  2. The report should disclose the methods used by the  researcher(s). Did the study last for three or thirty weeks?  Were there ten or one hundred participants? What did the  participants actually do? Did the researcher(s) observe the  results themselves or did they rely on self reports from  program participants?  3. Who were the subjects of this study? Humans or animals? If  human, are any traits/characteristics noted? You may realize  you have more in common with certain program participants  and can use that as a basis to gauge if the study applies to you.  4. Credible reports often disseminate new findings in the context  of previous research. A single study on its own gives you very  limited information, but if a body of literature supports a  finding, it adds to credibility.  5. Peer-reviewed articles deliver a broad perspective and are  inclusive of findings of many studies on the exact same subject.  6. When reading such news, ask yourself, “Is this making sense?”  Even if coffee does adversely affect the nervous system, do you  drink enough of it to see any negative effects?

Around the world, other cultures had  similar views of food and its relationship with health. A famous  quote by the Greek physician Hippocrates over two thousand years  ago, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” bear much  relevance on our food choices and their connection to our health.  Today, the scientific community echoes Hippocrates’ statement as  it recognizes some foods as functional foods. The Academy of  Nutrition and Dietetics defines functional foods as “whole foods  and fortified, enriched, or enhanced foods that have a potentially  beneficial effect on health when consumed as part of a varied diet  on a regular basis, at effective levels.”  In the latter nineteenth century, a Russian doctor of immunology,  Elie Metchnikoff, was intrigued by the healthy life spans of people  who lived in the tribes of the northern Caucasus Mountains. What  contributed to their long lifespan and their resistance to life- threatening diseases? A possible factor lay wrapped up in a leather  satchel used to hold fermented milk. Observing the connection  between the beverage and longevity, Dr. Elie Metchnikoff began his  research on beneficial bacteria and the longevity of life that led to  his book, The Prolongation of Life. He studied the biological effects  and chemical properties of the kefir elixir whose name came from  the Turkish word “kef” or “pleasure.” To this day, kefir is one of the  most widely enjoyed beverages in Russia.

What is the scientific evidence that kefir is a functional  food? Expert nutritionists agree that probiotics, such as kefir,  reduce the symptoms of lactose intolerance and can ward off virally  caused diarrhea. While some health claims remain unsubstantiated,  scientific studies are ongoing to determine the validity of other  health benefits of probiotics.  The Native Hawaiians also consumed a daily probiotic in their  diet commonly known as poi (pounded taro). In precolonial Hawai‘i,  poi was used for a wide variety of dietary and medicinal purposes.  Aside from poi’s nutrient dense composition, fermented poi has  numerous compounds created in the fermentation process that are  very beneficial to the health of the human body. As a probiotic,  evidence suggests that poi can be useful in helping diseases such  as diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory  bowel disease, and cancer.1  Another well-known probiotic to the local people of Hawai‘i is  Kimchi. Kimchi is a traditional Korean food that is manufactured by  fermenting vegetables (usually cabbage). Similar to the kefir and poi,  kimchi also has shown to have similar health benefits as a probiotic  food.2  The Japanese also have traditional fermented foods such as natto.

When you feel hungry, your body sends a message to your  brain that it is time to eat. Sights and smells influence your body’s  preparedness for food. Smelling food sends a message to your brain.  Your brain then tells the mouth to get ready, and you start to  salivate in preparation for a meal.  Once you have eaten, your digestive system (Figure 2.4 “The  Human Digestive System”) starts the process that breaks down the  components of food into smaller components that can be absorbed  and taken into the body. To do this, the digestive system functions  on two levels, mechanically to move and mix ingested food and  chemically to break down large molecules. The smaller nutrient  molecules can then be absorbed and processed by cells throughout  the body for energy\\xa0 or used as building blocks for new cells. The  digestive system is one of the eleven organ systems of the human  body, and it is composed of several hollow tube-shaped organs  including the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine,  large intestine (colon), rectum, and anus. It is lined with mucosal  tissue that secretes digestive juices (which aid in the breakdown of  food) and mucus (which facilitates the propulsion of food through  the tract). Smooth muscle tissue surrounds the digestive tract and  its contraction produces waves, known as peristalsis, that propel  food down the tract. Nutrients, as well as some non-nutrients, are  absorbed. Substances such as fiber get left behind and are  appropriately excreted.

The first step is ingestion, which is the  intake of food into the digestive tract. It may seem a simple process,  but ingestion involves smelling food, thinking about food, and the  involuntary release of saliva in the mouth to prepare for food entry.  In the mouth, where the second step of digestion starts, the  mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins. The chemical  breakdown of food involves enzymes, such as salivary amylase that  starts the breakdown of large starch molecules into smaller  components.  Mechanical breakdown starts with mastication (chewing) in the  mouth. Teeth crush and grind large food particles, while saliva  provides lubrication and enables food movement downward. The  slippery mass of partially broken-down food is called a bolus, which  moves down the digestive tract as you swallow. Swallowing may  seem voluntary at first because it requires conscious effort to push  the food with the tongue back toward the throat, but after this,  swallowing proceeds involuntarily, meaning it cannot be stopped  72  |  The Digestive System'},\n",

As you swallow, the bolus is pushed from the mouth  through the pharynx and into a muscular tube called the esophagus.  As the bolus travels through the pharynx, a small flap called the  epiglottis closes to prevent choking by keeping food from going  into the trachea. Peristaltic contractions also known as peristalsis in  the esophagus propel the food bolus down to the stomach (Figure  3.6 “Peristalsis in the Esophagus”). At the junction between the  esophagus and stomach there is a sphincter muscle that remains  closed until the food bolus approaches. The pressure of the food  bolus stimulates the lower esophageal sphincter to relax and open  and food then moves from the esophagus into the stomach. The  mechanical breakdown of food is accentuated by the muscular  contractions of the stomach and small intestine that mash, mix,  slosh, and propel food down the alimentary canal. Solid food takes  between four and eight seconds to travel down the esophagus, and  liquids take about one second.  Figure 2.6 Peristalsis in the Esophagus  The Digestive System  |  73'},\n",

Chyme is a semiliquid mass of partially digested food that  also contains gastric juices secreted by cells in the stomach. These  gastric juices contain hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin, that  chemically start breakdown of the protein components of food.  The length of time food spends in the stomach varies by the  macronutrient composition of the meal. A high-fat or high-protein  meal takes longer to break down than one rich in carbohydrates.  It usually takes a few hours after a meal to empty the stomach  contents completely into the small intestine.  The small intestine is divided into three structural parts: the  duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Once the chyme enters the  duodenum (the first segment of the small intestine), the pancreas  and gallbladder are stimulated and release juices that aid in  digestion. The pancreas secretes up to 1.5 liters (.4 US gallons) of  pancreatic juice through a duct into the duodenum per day. This  fluid consists mostly of water, but it also contains bicarbonate ions  that neutralize the acidity of the stomach-derived chyme and  enzymes that further break down proteins, carbohydrates, and  lipids. The gallbladder secretes a much smaller amount of a fluid  called bile that helps to digest fats. Bile passes through a duct that  joins the pancreatic ducts and is released into the duodenum. Bile  is made in the liver and stored in the gall bladder. Bile’s components  act like detergents by surrounding fats similar to the way dish soap  removes grease from a frying pan. This allows for the movement of  fats in the watery environment of the small intestine. Two different  types of muscular contractions, called peristalsis and segmentation,  control the movement and mixing of the food in various stages of  digestion through the small intestine.  Similar to what occurs in the esophagus and stomach, peristalsis  is circular waves of smooth muscle contraction that propel food  74  |  The Digestive System'},\n",

The heart pumps the blood, and the blood is the  transportation fluid. The transportation route to all tissues, a highly  intricate blood-vessel network, comprises arteries, veins, and  capillaries.

Arteries become smaller and smaller on their way to  cells, so that by the time blood reaches a cell, the artery’s diameter  is extremely small and the vessel is now called a capillary. The  reduced diameter of the blood vessel substantially slows the speed  of blood flow.

Wastes Out  In the metabolism of macronutrients to energy, cells produce the  waste products carbon dioxide and water. As blood travels through  smaller and smaller vessels, the rate of blood flow is dramatically  reduced, allowing for efficient exchange of nutrients and oxygen for  cellular waste products through tiny capillaries. The kidneys remove  any excess water from the blood, and blood delivers the carbon  dioxide to the lungs where it is exhaled. Also, the liver produces  the waste product urea from the breakdown of amino acids and  detoxifies many harmful substances, all of which require transport  in the blood to the kidneys for excretion.  All for One, One for All  The eleven organ systems in the body completely depend on each  other for continued survival as a complex organism. Blood allows for  transport of nutrients, wastes, water, and heat, and is also a conduit  of communication between organ systems. Blood’s importance to  the rest of the body is aptly presented in its role in glucose delivery,  especially to the brain. The brain metabolizes, on average, 6 grams  of glucose per hour. In order to avert confusion, coma, and death,  glucose must be readily available to the brain at all times. To  accomplish this task, cells in the pancreas sense glucose levels in  the blood. If glucose levels are low, the hormone glucagon is  released into the blood and is transported to the liver where it  communicates the signal to ramp-up glycogen breakdown and  glucose synthesis. The liver does just that, and glucose is released  88  |  The Cardiovascular System'},\n",

Maintaining healthy blood, including its continuous renewal, is  essential to support its vast array of vital functions. Blood is healthy  when it contains the appropriate amount of water and cellular  components and proper concentrations of dissolved substances,  such as albumin and electrolytes. As with all other tissues, blood  needs macro- and micronutrients to optimally function. In the bone  marrow, where blood cells are made, amino acids are required to  build the massive amount of hemoglobin packed within every red  blood cell, along with all other enzymes and cellular organelles  contained in each blood cell. Red blood cells, similar to the brain,  use only glucose as fuel, and it must be in constant supply to  support red-blood-cell metabolism. As with all other cells, the cells  in the blood are surrounded by a plasma membrane, which is  composed of mainly lipids. Blood health is also acutely sensitive to  deficiencies in some vitamins and minerals more than others.  What Can Blood Tests Tell You About Your  Health?

Neurons form the core of the central nervous system, which  consists of the brain, spinal cord, and other nerve bundles in the  body. The main function of the central nervous system is to sense  changes in the external environment and create a reaction to them.  For instance, if your finger comes into contact with a thorn on a  rose bush, a sensory neuron transmits a signal from your finger up  through the spinal cord and into the brain. Another neuron in the  brain sends a signal that travels back to the muscles in your hand  and stimulates muscles to contract and you jerk your finger away.  All of this happens within a tenth of a second. All nerve impulses  travel by the movement of charged sodium, potassium, calcium, and  chloride atoms. Nerves communicate with each other via chemicals  built from amino acids called neurotransmitters. Eating adequate  protein from a variety of sources will ensure the body gets all of the  different amino acids that are important for central nervous system  function.

Just as too much glucose is bad for other organs,  such as the kidneys and pancreas, it also produces negative effects  upon the brain.

The brain’s cognitive functions include  language processing, learning, perceiving, and thinking. Recent  scientific studies demonstrate that having continuously high blood- glucose levels substantially elevates the risk for developing  Alzheimer’s disease, which is the greatest cause of age-related  cognitive decline.  The good news is that much research is directed toward  determining the best diets and foods that slow cognitive decline and  maximize brain health. A study in the June 2010 issue of the Archives  of Neurology reports that people over age 65 who adhered to diets  that consisted of higher intakes of nuts, fish, poultry, tomatoes,  cruciferous vegetables, fruits, salad dressing, and dark green, and  leafy vegetables, as well as a lower intake of high-fat dairy products,  red meat, organ meat, and butter, had a much reduced risk for  Alzheimer’s disease.1  Other scientific studies provide supporting evidence that foods  rich in omega-3 fatty acids and/or antioxidants provide the brain  with protection against Alzheimer’s disease.

This is because  cells need to maintain oxidative metabolism for energy production  that continuously regenerates adenosine triphosphate (ATP). For  oxidative phosphorylation to occur, oxygen is used as a reactant and  carbon dioxide is released as a waste product. You may be surprised  to learn that although oxygen is a critical need for cells, it is actually  the accumulation of carbon dioxide that primarily drives your need  to breathe. Carbon dioxide is exhaled and oxygen is inhaled through  the respiratory system, which includes muscles to move air into  and out of the lungs, passageways through which air moves, and  microscopic gas exchange surfaces covered by capillaries. The  cardiovascular system transports gases from the lungs to tissues  throughout the body and vice versa. A variety of diseases can affect  the respiratory system, such as asthma, emphysema, chronic  obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and lung cancer. All of  these conditions affect the gas exchange process and result in  labored breathing and other difficulties.  The major organs of the respiratory system function primarily  to provide oxygen to body tissues for cellular respiration, remove  the waste product carbon dioxide, and help to maintain acid-base  balance. Portions of the respiratory system are also used for non- vital functions, such as sensing odors, producing speech, and for  straining, such as during childbirth or coughing.

The glands  secrete hormones, which are biological molecules that regulate  cellular processes in other target tissues, so they require  transportation by the circulatory system. Adequate nutrition is  critical for the functioning of all the glands in the endocrine system.  A protein deficiency impairs gonadal-hormone release, preventing  reproduction. Athletic teenage girls with very little body fat often  do not menstruate. Children who are malnourished usually do not  produce enough growth hormone and fail to reach normal height  for their age group. Probably the most popularized connection  between nutrition and the functions of the endocrine system is  that unhealthy dietary patterns are linked to obesity and the  development of Type 2 diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) estimates that twenty-six million Americans  have Type 2 diabetes as of 2011. This is 8.3 percent of the US  population. Counties with the highest incidence of obesity also have  the highest incidence of Type 2 diabetes. To see how the rise in  obesity in this country is paralleled by the rise in Type 2 diabetes,  review this report by the CDC.  https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/statistics/slides/ maps_diabetesobesity_trends.pdf\\xa0 What is the causal relationship between overnutrition and Type  2 diabetes? The prevailing theory is that the overconsumption of  high-fat and high-sugar foods causes changes in muscle, fat, and  liver cells that leads to a diminished response from the pancreatic  hormone insulin. These cells are called “insulin-resistant.” Insulin is  released after a meal and instructs the liver and other tissues to take  up glucose and fatty acids that are circulating in the blood. When  cells are resistant to insulin they do not take up enough glucose and  fatty acids, so glucose and fatty acids remain at high concentrations  in the blood. The chronic elevation of glucose and fatty acids in the  blood also causes damage to other tissues over time, so that people  who have Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for cardiovascular  disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, and eye disease.

However, there are additional, equally important functions played  by the system. Take for example, regulation of pH, a function shared  with the lungs and the buffers in the blood. Additionally, the  regulation of blood pressure is a role shared with the heart and  blood vessels. What about regulating the concentration of solutes  in the blood? Did you know that the kidney is important in  determining the concentration of red blood cells? Eighty-five  percent of the erythropoietin (EPO) produced to stimulate red blood  cell production is produced in the kidneys. The kidneys also  perform the final synthesis step of vitamin D production, converting  calcidiol to calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D.  If the kidneys fail, these functions are compromised or lost  altogether, with devastating effects on homeostasis. The affected  individual might experience weakness, lethargy, shortness of  breath, anemia, widespread edema (swelling), metabolic acidosis,  rising potassium levels, heart arrhythmias, and more. Each of these  functions is vital to your well-being and survival. The urinary  system, controlled by the nervous system, also stores urine until  a convenient time for disposal and then provides the anatomical  structures to transport this waste liquid to the outside of the body.  Failure of nervous control or the anatomical structures leading to  a loss of control of urination results in a condition called  incontinence.

The skeleton is composed of two main  parts, the axial and the appendicular parts. The axial skeleton  consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage, and is  composed of eighty bones. The appendicular skeleton consists of  the shoulder girdle, pelvic girdle, and upper and lower extremities,  and is composed of 126 bones. Bones are also categorized by size  and shape. There are four types of bone: long bones, short bones,  flat bones, and irregular bones. The longest bone in your body is the  femur (thigh bone), which extends from your hip to your knee. It is a  long bone and functions to support your weight as you stand, walk,  or run. Your wrist is composed of eight irregular-shaped bones,  which allow for the intricate movements of your hands. Your twelve  ribs on each side of your body are curved flat bones that protect  your heart and lungs. Thus, the bones’ different sizes and shapes  allow for their different functions.  Bones are composed of approximately 65 percent inorganic  material known as mineralized matrix. This mineralized matrix  consists of mostly crystallized hydroxyapatite. The bone’s hard  crystal matrix of bone tissue gives it its rigid structure. The other  35 percent of bone is organic material, most of which is the fibrous  protein collagen. The collagen fibers are networked throughout  bone tissue and provide it with flexibility and strength. The bones’  inorganic and organic materials are structured into two different  tissue types.

Bone Modeling and Remodeling  During infancy, childhood, and adolescence, bones are continuously  growing and changing shape through two processes called growth  (ossification) and modeling. In fact, in the first year of life, almost  100 percent of the bone tissue in the skeleton is replaced. In the  process of modeling, bone tissue is dismantled at one site and built  up at a different site. In adulthood, our bones stop growing and  modeling, but continue to go through a process of bone remodeling.  In the process of remodeling, bone tissue is degraded and built up  at the same location. About 10 percent of bone tissue is remodeled  each year in adults. Bones adapt their structure to the forces acting  upon them, even in adulthood. This phenomenon is called Wolff’s  law, which states that bones will develop a structure that is best  able to resist the forces acting upon them. This is why exercising,  especially when it involves weight-bearing activities, increases bone  strength.  The first step in bone remodeling is osteocyte activation.  Osteocytes  detect  changes  in  mechanical  forces,  calcium  homeostasis, or hormone levels. In the second step, osteoclasts are  recruited to the site of the degradation. Osteoclasts are large cells  with a highly irregular ruffled membrane. These cells fuse tightly  to the bone and secrete hydrogen ions, which acidify the local  environment and dissolve the minerals in the bone tissue matrix.  This process is called bone resorption and resembles pit excavation.  Our bodies excavate pits in our bone tissue because bones act as  storehouses for calcium and other minerals.

Moreover,  if you decide to train to run a marathon your bones will restructure  themselves by remodeling to be better able to sustain the forces of  their new function.  After a certain amount of bone is excavated, the osteoclasts begin  to die and bone resorption stops. In the third step of bone  remodeling, the site is prepared for building. In this stage, sugars  and proteins accumulate along the bone’s surface, forming a cement  line which acts to form a strong bond between the old bone and  the new bone that will be made. These first three steps take  approximately two to three weeks to complete. In the last step of  bone remodeling, osteoblasts lay down new osteoid tissue that fills  up the cavities that were excavated during the resorption process.  Osteoid is bone matrix tissue that is composed of proteins such as  collagen and is not mineralized yet. To make collagen, vitamin C is  required. A symptom of vitamin C deficiency (known as scurvy) is  bone pain, which is caused by diminished bone remodeling. After  the osteoid tissue is built up, the bone tissue begins to mineralize.  The last step of bone remodeling continues for months, and for a  much longer time afterward the mineralized bone is continuously  packed in a more dense fashion.  Thus, we can say that bone is a living tissue that continually  adapts itself to mechanical stress through the process of  remodeling.

Similar  to measuring blood pressure to predict the risk of stroke, a BMD  measurement can help predict the risk of bone fracture. The most  common tool used to measure BMD is called dual energy X-ray  absorptiometry (DEXA). During this procedure, a person lies on  their back and a DEXA scanner passes two X-ray beams through  their body. The amount of X-ray energy that passes through the  bone is measured for both beams. The total amount of the X-ray  energy that passes through a person varies depending on their bone  thickness. Using this information and a defined area of bone, the  amount of calcified tissue in grams per unit area (cm2) is calculated.  Most often the DEXA scan focuses on measuring BMD in the hip  and the spine. These measurements are then used as indicators of  overall bone strength and health. DEXA is the cheapest and most  accurate way to measure BMD. It also uses the lowest dose of  radiation. Other methods of measuring BMD include quantitative  computed tomography (QCT) and radiographic absorptiometry.  People at risk for developing bone disease are advised to have a  DEXA scan. We will discuss the many risk factors linked to an  increased incidence of osteoporosis and the steps a person can take  to prevent the disease from developing.

Other less realized components of the immune system are the skin  (which acts as a barricade), mucus (which traps and entangles  microorganisms), and even the bacteria in the large intestine (which  prevent the colonization of bad bacteria in the gut). Immune system  functions are completely dependent on dietary nutrients. In fact,  malnutrition is the leading cause of immune-system deficiency  worldwide. When immune system functions are inadequate there is  a marked increase in the chance of getting an infection. Children  in many poor, developing countries have protein- and/or energy- deficient diets that are causative of two different syndromes,  kwashiorkor and marasmus. These children often die from  infections that their bodies would normally have fought off, but  because their protein and/or energy intake is so low, the immune  system cannot perform its functions.  Other nutrients, such as iron, zinc, selenium, copper, folate, and  vitamins A, B6, C, D, and E, all provide benefits to immune system  function. Deficiencies in these nutrients can cause an increased risk  for infection and death. Zinc deficiency results in suppression of the  immune system’s barrier functions by damaging skin cells; it is also  associated with a decrease in the number of circulating white blood  cells.

BMI Limitations  A BMI is a fairly simple measurement and does not take into account  fat mass or fat distribution in the body, both of which are additional  predictors of disease risk. Body fat weighs less than muscle mass.  Therefore, BMI can sometimes underestimate the amount of body  fat in overweight or obese people and overestimate it in more  muscular people. For instance, a muscular athlete will have more  muscle mass (which is heavier than fat mass) than a sedentary  individual of the same height. Based on their BMIs the muscular  athlete would be less “ideal” and may be categorized as more  overweight or obese than the sedentary individual; however this is  an infrequent problem with BMI calculation. Additionally, an older  person with osteoporosis (decreased bone mass) will have a lower  BMI than an older person of the same height without osteoporosis,  even though the person with osteoporosis may have more fat mass.  BMI is a useful inexpensive tool to categorize people and is highly  correlative with disease risk, but other measurements are needed to  diagnose obesity and more accurately assess disease risk.

Having more fat mass may be indicative of disease  risk, but fat mass also varies with sex, age, and physical activity  level. Females have more fat mass, which is needed for reproduction  and, in part, is a consequence of different levels of hormones. The  optimal fat content of a female is between 20 and 30 percent of  her total weight and for a male is between 12 and 20 percent. Fat  mass can be measured in a variety of ways. The simplest and lowest- cost way is the skin-fold test. A health professional uses a caliper to  measure the thickness of skin on the back, arm, and other parts of  the body and compares it to standards to assess body fatness. It is  a noninvasive and fairly accurate method of measuring fat mass, but  similar to BMI, is compared to standards of mostly young to middle- aged adults.

Fat can be found  in different areas in the body and it does not all act the same,  meaning it differs physiologically based on location. Fat deposited in  the abdominal cavity is called visceral fat and it is a better predictor  of disease risk than total fat mass. Visceral fat releases hormones  and inflammatory factors that contribute to disease risk. The only  tool required for measuring visceral fat is a measuring tape.

A human body is made up of mostly water.  An adult consists of about 37 to 42 liters of water, or about eighty  pounds. Fortunately, humans have compartmentalized tissues;  otherwise we might just look like a water balloon! Newborns are  approximately 70 percent water. Adult males typically are composed  of about 60 percent water and females are about 55 percent water.  (This gender difference reflects the differences in body-fat content,  since body fat is practically water-free. This also means that if a  person gains weight in the form of fat the percentage of total body  water content declines.) As we age, total body water content also  diminishes so that by the time we are in our eighties the percent  of water in our bodies has decreased to around 45 percent. Does  the loss in body water play a role in the aging process? Alas, no  one knows. But, we do know that dehydration accelerates the aging  process whereas keeping hydrated decreases headaches, muscle  aches, and kidney stones.

The  processes involved keep fluids from becoming too dilute or too  concentrated. Fluid compartments are separated by selectively  permeable membranes, which allow some things, such as water,  to move through while other substances require special transport  proteins, channels, and often energy. The movement of water  between fluid compartments happens by osmosis, which is simply  the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane  from an area where it is highly concentrated to an area where it  is not so concentrated. Water is never transported actively; that is,  it never takes energy for water to move between compartments.  Although cells do not directly control water movement, they do  control movement of electrolytes and other solutes and thus  indirectly regulate water movement by controlling where there will  be regions of high and low concentrations.  Cells maintain their water volume at a constant level, but the  composition of solutes in a cell is in a continuous state of flux.  This is because cells are bringing nutrients in, metabolizing them,  and disposing of waste products. To maintain water balance a cell  controls the movement of electrolytes to keep the total number of  dissolved particles, called osmolality the same inside and outside  (Figure 3.3 “Osmoregulation”). The total number of dissolved  substances is the same inside and outside a cell, but the  composition of the fluids differs between compartments.

A pile of undissolved salt would be difficult to move  throughout tissues, as would a bubble of gas or a glob of fat. Blood,  the primary transport fluid in the body is about 78 percent water.  Dissolved substances in blood include proteins, lipoproteins,  glucose, electrolytes, and metabolic waste products, such as carbon  dioxide and urea. These substances are either dissolved in the  watery surrounding of blood to be transported to cells to support  basic functions or are removed from cells to prevent waste build- up and toxicity. Blood is not just the primary vehicle of transport in  the body, but also as a fluid tissue blood structurally supports blood  vessels that would collapse in its absence. For example, the brain  which consists of 75 percent water is used to provide structure.  Water As a Medium for Chemical Reactions  Water is required for even the most basic chemical reactions.  Proteins fold into their functional shape based on how their amino- acid sequences react with water. These newly formed enzymes  must conduct their specific chemical reactions in a medium, which  in all organisms is water.

Human life  is supported within a narrow range of temperature, with the  temperature set point of the body being 98.6°F (37°C). Too low or  too high of a temperature causes enzymes to stop functioning and  metabolism is halted. At 82.4°F (28°C) muscle failure occurs and  hypothermia sets in. At the opposite extreme of 111.2°F (44°C) the  central nervous system fails and death results. Water is good at  storing heat, an attribute referred to as heat capacity and thus helps  maintain the temperature set point of the body despite changes in  the surrounding environment.  There are several mechanisms in place that move body water  from place to place as a method to distribute heat in the body and  equalize body temperature (Figure 3.4 “Thermoregulatory Center”).  The hypothalamus in the brain is the thermoregulatory center. The  hypothalamus contains special protein sensors that detect blood  temperature. The skin also contains temperature sensors that  respond quickly to changes in immediate surroundings. In response  to cold sensors in the skin, a neural signal is sent to the  hypothalamus, which then sends a signal to smooth muscle tissue  surrounding blood vessels causing them to constrict and reduce  blood flow. This reduces heat lost to the environment. The  hypothalamus also sends signals to muscles to erect hairs and shiver  and to endocrine glands like the thyroid to secrete hormones  capable of ramping up metabolism. These actions increase heat  conservation and stimulate its production in the body in response  to cooling temperatures.

The thirst mechanism is activated in response to changes in water  volume in the blood, but is even more sensitive to changes in blood  osmolality. Blood osmolality is primarily driven by the concentration  of sodium cations. The urge to drink results from a complex  interplay of hormones and neuronal responses that coordinate to  increase water input and contribute toward fluid balance and  composition in the body. The “thirst center” is contained within  the hypothalamus, a portion of the brain that lies just above the  brainstem. In older people the thirst mechanism is not as responsive  and as we age there is a higher risk for dehydration. Thirst happens  in the following sequence of physiological events:  1. Receptor proteins in the kidney, heart, and hypothalamus  detect decreased fluid volume or increased sodium  concentration in the blood.  2. Hormonal and neural messages are relayed to the brain’s thirst  center in the hypothalamus.  The hypothalamus sends neural signals to higher sensory areas  in the cortex of the brain, stimulating the conscious thought to  drink.  3. Fluids are consumed.  4. Receptors in the mouth and stomach detect mechanical  movements involved with fluid ingestion.  5. Neural signals are sent to the brain and the thirst mechanism  is shut off.  The physiological control of thirst is the backup mechanism to  increase water input. Fluid intake is controlled primarily by  conscious eating and drinking habits dependent on social and  cultural influences. For example, you might have a habit of drinking  a glass of orange juice and eating a bowl of cereal every morning  before school or work.  166  |  Regulation of Water Balance'},\n",

The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.

Similarly, when an electrolyte at higher concentration in  the extracellular fluid is transported into a cell, the potential energy  is harnessed and used to perform work.  Cells are constantly transporting nutrients in and wastes out.  How is the concentration of solutes maintained if they are in a  state of flux? This is where electrolytes come into play. The cell  (or more specifically the numerous sodium-potassium pumps in  its membrane) continuously pumps sodium ions out to establish  a chemical gradient. The transport protein, called the glucose  symporter, uses the sodium gradient to power glucose movement  into the cell. Sodium and glucose both move into the cell. Water  passively follows the sodium. To restore balance, the sodium- potassium pump transfers sodium back to the extracellular fluid and  water follows. Every cycle of the sodium-potassium pump involves  the movement of three sodium ions out of a cell, in exchange for  two potassium ions into a cell. To maintain charge neutrality on the  outside of cells every sodium cation is followed by a chloride anion.  Every cycle of the pump costs one molecule of ATP (adenosine  triphosphate). The constant work of the sodium-potassium pump  maintains the solute  equilibrium  and consequently, water  distribution between intracellular and extracellular fluids.  The unequal movement of the positively charged sodium and  potassium ions makes intracellular fluid more negatively charged  than the extracellular fluid. This charge gradient is another source  of energy that a cell uses to perform work.

In contrast to many minerals,  sodium absorption in the small intestine is extremely efficient and  in a healthy individual all excess sodium is excreted by the kidneys.  In fact, very little sodium is required in the diet (about 200  milligrams) because the kidneys actively reabsorb sodium. Kidney  reabsorption of sodium is hormonally controlled, allowing for a  relatively constant sodium concentration in the blood.  Other Functions of Sodium in the Body  The second notable function of sodium is in nerve impulse  transmission. Nerve impulse transmission results from the  transport of sodium cations into a nerve cell, which creates a charge  difference (or voltage) between the nerve cell and its extracellular  environment. Similar to how a current moves along a wire, a sodium  current moves along a nerve cell. Stimulating a muscle contraction  also involves the movement of sodium ions as well as other ion  movements.  Sodium is essential for nutrient absorption in the small intestine  and also for nutrient reabsorption in the kidney. Amino acids,  glucose and water must make their way from the small intestine to  the blood. To do so, they pass through intestinal cells on their way  to the blood. The transport of nutrients through intestinal cells is  facilitated by the sodium-potassium pump, which by moving sodium  out of the cell, creates a higher sodium concentration outside of the  cell (requiring ATP).  176  |  Sodium'},\n",

Sweat  is mostly water but also contains some electrolytes, mostly sodium  and chloride. Under normal environmental conditions (i.e., not hot,  humid days) water and sodium loss through sweat is negligible,  but is highly variable among individuals. It is estimated that sixty  minutes of high-intensity physical activity, like playing a game of  tennis, can produce approximately one liter of sweat; however the  amount of sweat produced is highly dependent on environmental  conditions. A liter of sweat typically contains between 1 and 2 grams  of sodium and therefore exercising for multiple hours can result in a  high amount of sodium loss in some people. Additionally, hard labor  can produce substantial sodium loss through sweat. In either case,  the lost sodium is easily replaced in the next snack or meal.  In athletes hyponatremia, or a low blood-sodium level, is not  so much the result of excessive sodium loss in sweat, but rather  drinking too much water. The excess water dilutes the sodium  concentration in blood. Illnesses causing vomiting, sweating, and  diarrhea may also cause hyponatremia. The symptoms of  hyponatremia, also called water intoxication (since it is often the  root cause) include nausea, muscle cramps, confusion, dizziness,  and in severe cases, coma and death. The physiological events that  occur in water intoxication are the following:  1. Excessive sodium loss and/or water intake.  2. Sodium levels fall in blood and in the fluid between cells.  3. Water moves to where solutes are more concentrated (i.e. into  cells).  4. Cells swell.  5.

Sports drinks  are better at restoring fluid and blood-glucose levels than replacing  electrolytes. During an endurance event you would be better off  drinking water and eating an energy bar that contains sugars,  proteins, and electrolytes. The American College of Sports Medicine  suggests if you are exercising for longer than one hour you eat one  high carbohydrate (25–40 grams) per hour of exercise along with  ample water.1  Watch out for the fat content, as sometimes energy bars contain  a hefty dose. If you’re not exercising over an hour at high intensity,  you can skip the sports drinks, but not the water. For those who do  not exercise or do so at low to moderate intensity, sports drinks are  another source of extra calories, sugar, and salt.

The IOM estimates that greater than 95  percent of men and 75 percent of women in America consume  salt in excess of the UL. Many scientific studies demonstrate that  reducing salt intake prevents hypertension, is helpful in reducing  blood pressure after hypertension is diagnosed, and reduces the  risk for cardiovascular disease. The IOM recommends that people  over fifty, African Americans, diabetics, and those with chronic  kidney disease should consume no more than 1,500 milligrams of  sodium per day. The American Heart Association (AHA) states that  all Americans, not just those listed, should consume less than 1,500  milligrams of sodium per day to prevent cardiovascular disease.

However, many salt substitutes still contain sodium, just in lesser  amounts than table salt. Also, remember that most salt in the diet is  not from table-salt use, but from processed foods. Salt substitutes  often replace the sodium with potassium. People with kidney  disorders often have problems getting rid of excess potassium in the  diet and are advised to avoid salt substitutes containing potassium.

In addition to  passively following sodium, chloride has its own protein channels  that reside in cell membranes. These protein channels are especially  abundant in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and lungs.  Chloride’s Role in Fluid Balance  Chloride aids in fluid balance mainly because it follows sodium in  order to maintain charge neutrality. Chloride channels also play a  role in regulating fluid secretion, such as pancreatic juice into the  small intestine and the flow of water into mucus. Fluid secretion and  mucus are important for many of life’s processes. Their importance  is exemplified in the signs and symptoms of the genetic disease,  cystic fibrosis.  Cystic Fibrosis  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most prevalent inherited diseases  in people of European descent. It is caused by a mutation in a  protein that transports chloride ions out of the cell. CF’s signs and  symptoms include salty skin, poor digestion and absorption (leading  to poor growth), sticky mucus accumulation in the lungs (causing  increased susceptibility to respiratory infections), liver damage, and  infertility.  190  |  Chloride'},\n",

Blood pH is maintained in a narrow range and  the number of positively charged substances is equal to the number  of negatively charged substances. Proteins, such as albumin, as well  as bicarbonate ions and chloride ions, are negatively charged and  aid in maintaining blood pH. Hydrochloric acid (a gastric acid  composed of chlorine and hydrogen) aids in digestion and also  prevents the growth of unwanted microbes in the stomach.  Immune-system cells require chloride, and red blood cells use  chloride anions to remove carbon dioxide from the body.  Chloride Imbalances  Low dietary intake of chloride and more often diarrhea can cause  low blood levels of chloride. Symptoms typically are similar to those  of hyponatremia and include weakness, nausea, and headache.  Excess chloride in the blood is rare with no characteristic signs or  symptoms.  Needs and Dietary Sources of Chloride  Most chloride in the diet comes from salt. (Salt is 60 percent  chloride.) A teaspoon of salt equals 5,600 milligrams, with each  teaspoon of salt containing 3,400 milligrams of chloride and 2,200  milligrams of sodium. The chloride AI for adults, set by the IOM, is  2,300 milligrams. Therefore just ⅔ teaspoon of table salt per day  is sufficient for chloride as well as sodium.

Ninety percent of potassium exists in intracellular fluid, with  about 10 percent in extracellular fluid, and only 1 percent in blood  plasma. As with sodium, potassium levels in the blood are strictly  regulated. The hormone aldosterone is what primarily controls  potassium levels, but other hormones (such as insulin) also play  a role. When potassium levels in the blood increase, the adrenal  glands release aldosterone. The aldosterone acts on the collecting  ducts of kidneys, where it stimulates an increase in the number  of sodium-potassium pumps. Sodium is then reabsorbed and more  potassium is excreted. Because potassium is required for  maintaining sodium levels, and hence fluid balance, about 200  milligrams of potassium are lost from the body every day.  Other Functions of Potassium in the Body  Nerve impulse involves not only sodium, but also potassium. A nerve  impulse moves along a nerve via the movement of sodium ions into  the cell. To end the impulse, potassium ions rush out of the nerve  cell, thereby decreasing the positive charge inside the nerve cell.  This diminishes the stimulus. To restore the original concentrations  of ions between the intracellular and extracellular fluid, the sodium- potassium pump transfers sodium ions out in exchange for  potassium  ions  in.  On  completion  of  the  restored  ion  concentrations, a nerve cell is now ready to receive the next  impulse.

The signs and symptoms  of hypokalemia are related to the functions of potassium in nerve  cells and consequently skeletal and smooth-muscle contraction.  The signs and symptoms include muscle weakness and cramps,  respiratory distress, and constipation. Severe potassium depletion  can cause the heart to have abnormal contractions and can even  be fatal. High levels of potassium in the blood, or hyperkalemia,  also affects the heart.

Extremely high levels of potassium in the  blood disrupt the electrical impulses that stimulate the heart and  can cause the heart to stop. Hyperkalemia is usually the result of  kidney dysfunction.

Excessive water intake can dilute the levels of critical  electrolytes in the blood. Water intoxication is rare, however when  it does happen, it can be deadly. On the other hand, having too little  water in the body is common. In fact, diarrhea-induced dehydration  is the number-one cause of early-childhood death worldwide. In  this section we will discuss subtle changes in electrolytes that  compromise health on a chronic basis.  High-Hydration Status: Water Intoxication/ Hyponatremia  Water intoxication mainly affects athletes who overhydrate. Water  intoxication is extremely rare, primarily because healthy kidneys  are capable of excreting up to one liter of excess water per hour.  Overhydration was unfortunately demonstrated in 2007 by Jennifer  Strange, who drank six liters of water in three hours while  competing in a “Hold Your Wee for a Wii” radio contest.

Dehydration can be caused  by prolonged physical activity without adequate water intake, heat  exposure, excessive weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, blood loss,  infectious diseases, malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and very  high glucose levels. Physiologically, dehydration decreases blood  volume. The water in cells moves into the blood to compensate  for the low blood-volume, and cells shrink. Signs and symptoms  of dehydration include thirst, dizziness, fainting, headaches, low  blood-pressure, fatigue, low to no urine output, and, in extreme  cases, loss of consciousness and death. Signs and symptoms are  usually noticeable after about 2 percent of total body water is lost.  Chronic dehydration is linked to higher incidences of some  diseases. There is strong evidence that low-hydration status  increases the risk for kidney stones and exercise-induced asthma.  There is also some scientific evidence that chronic dehydration  increases the risk for kidney disease, heart disease, and the  development of hyperglycemia in people with diabetes. Older  people often suffer from chronic dehydration as their thirst  mechanism is no longer as sensitive as it used to be.  Heat Stroke  Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the  body temperature is greater than 104°F (40°C). It is the result of  the body being unable to sufficiently cool itself by thermoregulatory  mechanisms. Dehydration is a primary cause of heat stroke as there  are not enough fluids in the body to maintain adequate sweat  production, and cooling of the body is impaired. Signs and  symptoms are dry skin (absence of sweating), dizziness, trouble  breathing, rapid pulse, confusion, agitation, seizures, coma, and  possibly death.

About  15 percent of Americans obtain drinking water from private wells,  which are not subject to EPA standards.  Producing water safe for drinking involves some or all of the  following processes: screening out large objects, removing excess  calcium carbonate from hard water sources, flocculation, which  adds a precipitating agent to remove solid particles, clarification,  sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. These processes aim to  remove unhealthy substances and produce high-quality, colorless,  odorless, good-tasting water.  Most drinking water is disinfected by the process of chlorination,  which involves adding chlorine compounds to the water.  Chlorination is cheap and effective at killing bacteria. However, it is  less effective at removing protozoa, such as Giardia lamblia.  Chlorine-resistant protozoa and viruses are instead removed by  extensive filtration methods. In the decades immediately following  the implementation of water chlorination and disinfection methods  in this country, waterborne illnesses, such as cholera and typhoid  fever, essentially disappeared in the United States (Figure 3.12  “Deadly Water-borne Illnesses In United States”).

Health Benefits  The most renowned effects of caffeine on the body are increased  alertness and delay of fatigue and sleep. How does caffeine  stimulate the brain? Caffeine is chemically similar to a chemical in  our brains (adenosine). Caffeine interacts with adenosine’s specific  protein receptor. It blocks the actions of the adenosine, and affects  the levels of signaling molecules in the brain, leading to an increase  in energy metabolism. At the molecular level, caffeine stimulates the  brain, increasing alertness and causing a delay of fatigue and sleep.  At high doses caffeine stimulates the motor cortex of the brain and  interferes with the sleep-wake cycle, causing side effects such as  shakiness, anxiety, and insomnia. People’s sensitivity to the adverse  effects of caffeine varies and some people develop side effects at  much lower doses. The many effects caffeine has on the brain do  not diminish with habitual drinking of caffeinated beverages.  Tools for Change  Consuming caffeine in the evening and in the middle of the night  will help keep you awake to study for an exam, but it will not  enhance your performance on the next day’s test if you do not get  enough sleep. Drink caffeinated beverages in moderation at any  time of the day or evening to increase alertness (if you are not  sensitive to caffeine’s adverse effects), but get the recommended  amount of sleep.  It is important to note that caffeine has some effects on health  that are either promoted or masked by the other beneficial  218  |  Popular Beverage Choices'},\n",

Some have hypothesized that caffeine elevates calcium excretion  and therefore could potentially harm bones. The scientific  consensus at this time is that caffeine minimally affects calcium  levels and intake is not associated with any increased risk for  osteoporosis or the incidence of fractures in most women. Although  the effect of caffeine on calcium excretion is small, postmenopausal  women with risk factors for osteoporosis may want to make sure  their dietary caffeine intake is low or moderate and not excessive.  The Caffeine Myth  A diuretic refers to any substance that elevates the normal urine  output above that of drinking water. Caffeinated beverages are  commonly believed to be dehydrating due to their diuretic effect,  but results from scientific studies do not support that caffeinated  beverages increase urine output more so than water. This does not  mean that consuming caffeinated beverages does not affect urine  output, but rather that it does not increase urine output more than  water does. Thus, caffeinated beverages are considered a source of  hydration similar to water.  Sports Drinks  Scientific  studies  under  certain  circumstances  show  that  consuming sports drinks (instead of plain water) during high- intensity exercise lasting longer than one hour significantly  enhances endurance, and some evidence indicates it additionally  enhances performance.

              "  'text': 'drinking sports drinks instead of plain water enhances endurance  or performance in individuals exercising less than one hour and at  low to moderate intensities. A well-concocted sports drink contains  sugar, water, and sodium in the correct proportions so that  hydration is optimized. The sugar is helpful in maintaining blood- glucose levels needed to fuel muscles, the water keeps an athlete  hydrated, and the sodium enhances fluid absorption and replaces  some of that lost in sweat. The American College of Sports Medicine  states that the goal of drinking fluids during exercise is to prevent  dehydration, which compromises performance and endurance.  The primary source of water loss during intense physical activity  is sweat. Perspiration rates are variable and dependent on many  factors including body composition, humidity, temperature, and  type of exercise. The hydration goal for obtaining optimal  endurance and performance is to replace what is lost, not to over- hydrate. A person’s sweating rate can be approximated by  measuring weight before and after exercise—the difference in  weight will be the amount of water weight you lost.  The primary electrolyte lost in sweat is sodium. One liter of sweat  can contain between 1,000–2,000 milligrams of sodium. Potassium,  magnesium, and calcium are also lost, but in much lower amounts. If  you are exercising at high intensity for greater than ninety minutes,  it is important to replace sodium as well as water. This can be partly  accomplished by consuming a sports drink. The highest content of  sodium in commercial sports drinks is approximately 450 milligrams  per liter and thus will not replace all lost sodium unless a person  drinks several liters. This is NOT recommended, as water  intoxication not only compromises performance, but may also be  deadly. The sodium in sports drinks enhances fluid absorption so  that rehydration is more efficiently accomplished. If you are not  exercising for more than ninety minutes at a high intensity, dietary  intake of sodium and other electrolytes should be sufficient for  replacing lost electrolytes.

Children and adult athletes exercising for more than one hour at  high-intensity (tennis, rowing, rugby, soccer, etc.) may benefit  endurance-wise and possibly performance-wise from consuming a  sports drink rather than water. However, consuming sports drinks  provides no benefit over water to endurance, performance, or  exercise recovery for those exercising less than an hour. In fact, as  with all other sugary drinks containing few to no nutrients, they are  only another source of calories. Drinking sports drinks when you  are doing no exercise at all is not recommended.  Sports Drink Alternatives  Instead of a sports drink, you can replenish lost fluids and obtain  energy and electrolytes during exercise by drinking plain water and  eating a sports bar or snack that contains carbohydrates, protein,  and electrolytes. Post-exercise, low-fat milk has been scientifically  shown to be just as effective as a sports drink as a rehydration  beverage and it is more nutrient-dense, containing carbohydrates,  protein, and electrolytes, in addition to other vitamins.  The Bottom Line  Sports drinks consumed in excess by athletes or used by non- athletes simply are another source of added sugars, and thus extra  calories, in the diet and provide no performance, exercise recovery  or health benefit.  224  |  Popular Beverage Choices'},\n",

Chewing, also known as mastication, crumbles the  carbohydrate foods into smaller and smaller pieces. The salivary  glands in the oral cavity secrete saliva that coats the food particles.  Saliva contains the enzyme, salivary amylase. This enzyme breaks  the bonds between the monomeric sugar units of disaccharides,  oligosaccharides, and starches. The salivary amylase breaks down  amylose and amylopectin into smaller chains of glucose, called  dextrins and maltose. The increased concentration of maltose in the  mouth that results from the mechanical and chemical breakdown  of starches in whole grains is what enhances their sweetness. Only  about five percent of starches are broken down in the mouth. (This  is a good thing as more glucose in the mouth would lead to more  tooth decay.) When carbohydrates reach the stomach no further  chemical breakdown occurs because the amylase enzyme does not  function in the acidic conditions of the stomach. But mechanical  breakdown is ongoing—the strong peristaltic contractions of the  stomach mix the carbohydrates into the more uniform mixture of  chyme.

The type of carbohydrate within a food affects the GI along with  its fat and fiber content. Increased fat and fiber in foods increases  the time required for digestion and delays the rate of gastric  emptying into the small intestine which, ultimately reduces the GI.  Processing and cooking also affects a food’s GI by increasing their  digestibility. Advancements in the technologies of food processing  and the high consumer demand for convenient, precooked foods in  the United States has created foods that are digested and absorbed  more rapidly, independent of the fiber content. Modern breakfast  cereals, breads, pastas, and many prepared foods have a high GI.  In contrast, most raw foods have a lower GI. (However, the more  ripened a fruit or vegetable is, the higher its GI.)  The GI can be used as a guide for choosing healthier carbohydrate  choices but has some limitations. The first is GI does not take into  account the amount of carbohydrates in a portion of food, only the  type of carbohydrate. Another is that combining low- and high-GI  foods changes the GI for the meal. Also, some nutrient-dense foods  have higher GIs than less nutritious food. (For instance, oatmeal has  a higher GI than chocolate because the fat content of chocolate is  higher.) Lastly, meats and fats do not have a GI since they do not  contain carbohydrates.  250  |  Digestion and Absorption of Carbohydrates'},\n",

They are energy production, energy storage, building  macromolecules, sparing protein, and assisting in lipid metabolism.  Energy Production  The primary role of carbohydrates is to supply energy to all cells  in the body. Many cells prefer glucose as a source of energy versus  other compounds like fatty acids. Some cells, such as red blood  cells, are only able to produce cellular energy from glucose. The  brain is also highly sensitive to low blood-glucose levels because  it uses only glucose to produce energy and function (unless under  extreme starvation conditions). About 70 percent of the glucose  entering the body from digestion is redistributed (by the liver) back  into the blood for use by other tissues. Cells that require energy  remove the glucose from the blood with a transport protein in their  membranes. The energy from glucose comes from the chemical  bonds between the carbon atoms. Sunlight energy was required to  produce these high-energy bonds in the process of photosynthesis.  Cells in our bodies break these bonds and capture the energy to  perform cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is basically a  controlled burning of glucose versus an uncontrolled burning. A cell  uses many chemical reactions in multiple enzymatic steps to slow  the release of energy (no explosion) and more efficiently capture the  energy held within the chemical bonds in glucose.

The weakening  of muscles sets in because it takes longer to transform the chemical  energy in fatty acids and proteins to usable energy than glucose.  After prolonged exercise, glycogen is gone and muscles must rely  more on lipids and proteins as an energy source. Athletes can  increase their glycogen reserve modestly by reducing training  intensity and increasing their carbohydrate intake to between 60  and 70 percent of total calories three to five days prior to an event.  People who are not hardcore training and choose to run a  5-kilometer race for fun do not need to consume a big plate of  pasta prior to a race since without long-term intense training the  adaptation of increased muscle glycogen will not happen.  The liver, like muscle, can store glucose energy as a glycogen,  but in contrast to muscle tissue it will sacrifice its stored glucose  energy to other tissues in the body when blood glucose is low.  Approximately one-quarter of total body glycogen content is in the  liver (which is equivalent to about a four-hour supply of glucose)  but this is highly dependent on activity level. The liver uses this  glycogen reserve as a way to keep blood-glucose levels within a  narrow range between meal times. When the liver’s glycogen supply  is exhausted, glucose is made from amino acids obtained from the  destruction of proteins in order to maintain metabolic homeostasis.

This  is because an increase in blood glucose stimulates release of the  hormone insulin, which tells cells to use glucose (instead of lipids) to  make energy. Adequate glucose levels in the blood also prevent the  development of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic condition resulting  from an elevation of ketone bodies in the blood. Ketone bodies are  an alternative energy source that cells can use when glucose supply  is insufficient, such as during fasting. Ketone bodies are acidic and  high elevations in the blood can cause it to become too acidic. This  is rare in healthy adults, but can occur in alcoholics, people who  are malnourished, and in individuals who have Type 1 diabetes. The  minimum amount of carbohydrate in the diet required to inhibit  ketosis in adults is 50 grams per day.  Carbohydrates  are  critical  to  support  life’s  most  basic  function—the production of energy. Without energy none of the  other life processes are performed. Although our bodies can  synthesize glucose it comes at the cost of protein destruction. As  with all nutrients though, carbohydrates are to be consumed in  moderation as having too much or too little in the diet may lead to  health problems.

Health consequences linked to being  overweight or obese include Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular  disease, arthritis, depression, and some cancers. An infatuation with  sugary foods and refined grains likely contributes to the epidemic  proportion of people who are overweight or obese in this country,  but so do the consumption of high-calorie foods that contain too  much saturated fat and the sedentary lifestyle of most Americans.  There is much disagreement over whether high-carbohydrate diets  increase weight-gain and disease risk, especially when calories are  not significantly higher between compared diets. Many scientific  studies demonstrate positive correlations between diets high in  added sugars with weight gain and disease risk, but some others do  not show a significant relationship. In regard to refined grains, there  are no studies that show consumption of refined grains increases  weight gain or disease risk. What is clear, however, is that getting  more of your carbohydrates from dietary sources containing whole  grains instead of refined grains stimulates weight loss and reduces  disease risk.  A major source of added sugars in the American diet is soft drinks.  There is consistent scientific evidence that consuming sugary soft  drinks increases weight gain and disease risk.

The Most Notorious Sugar  Before high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) was marketed as the best  food and beverage sweetener, sucrose (table sugar) was the  number-one sweetener in America. (Recall that sucrose, or table  sugar, is a disaccharide consisting of one glucose unit and one  fructose unit.) HFCS also contains the simple sugars fructose and  glucose, but with fructose at a slightly higher concentration. In  the production of HFCS, corn starch is broken down to glucose,  and some of the glucose is then converted to fructose. Fructose  is sweeter than glucose; hence many food manufacturers choose  to sweeten foods with HFCS. HFCS is used as a sweetener for  carbonated beverages, condiments, cereals, and a great variety of  other processed foods.  Some scientists, public health personnel, and healthcare  providers believe that fructose is the cause of the obesity epidemic  and its associated health consequences. The majority of their  evidence stems from the observation that since the early 1970s  the number of overweight or obese Americans has dramatically  increased and so has the consumption of foods containing HFCS.  However, as discussed, so has the consumption of added sugars  in general. Animal studies that fuel the fructose opponents show  fructose is not used to produce energy in the body; instead it is  mostly converted to fat in the liver—potentially contributing to  insulin resistance and the development of Type 2 diabetes.  Additionally, fructose does not stimulate the release of certain  appetite-suppressing hormones, like insulin, as glucose does.

Overall, there is no good  evidence that moderate fructose consumption contributes to  weight gain and chronic disease. At this time conclusive evidence  is not available on whether fructose is any worse than any other  added sugar in increasing the risk for obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and  cardiovascular disease.

Now that we know the benefits of eating the right  carbohydrate, we will examine exactly how much should be eaten to  promote health and prevent disease.  How Many Carbohydrates Does a Person Need?  The Food and Nutrition Board of IOM has set the Recommended  Dietary Allowance (RDA) of carbohydrates for children and adults  at 130 grams per day. This is the average minimum amount the  brain requires to function properly. The Acceptable Macronutrient  Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrates is between 45 and  65 percent of your total caloric daily intake. This means that on  a 2,000 kilocalorie diet, a person should consume between 225  and 325 grams of carbohydrate each day. According to the IOM  not more than 25 percent of total calories consumed should come  from added sugars. The World Health Organization and the AHA  recommend much lower intakes of added sugars—10 percent or less  of total calories consumed. The IOM has also set Adequate Intakes  for dietary fiber, which are 38 and 25 grams for men and women,  respectively. The recommendations for dietary fiber are based upon  the intake levels known to prevent against heart disease.

It’s the Whole Nutrient Package  In choosing dietary sources of carbohydrates the best ones are  those that are nutrient dense, meaning they contain more essential  nutrients per calorie of energy. In general, nutrient-dense  carbohydrates are minimally processed and include whole-grain  breads and cereals, low-fat dairy products, fruits, vegetables, and  beans. In contrast, empty-calorie carbohydrate foods are highly  processed and often contain added sugars and fats. Soft drinks,  cakes, cookies, and candy are examples of empty-calorie  carbohydrates.  They  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  ‘bad  carbohydrates,’ as they are known to cause health problems when  consumed in excess.  Understanding Carbohydrates from Product  Information  While nutrition facts labels aid in determining the amount of  carbohydrates you eat, they do not help in determining whether  a food is refined or not. The ingredients list provides some help  in this regard. It identifies all of the food’s ingredients in order of  concentration, with the most concentrated ingredient first. When  choosing between two breads, pick the one that lists whole wheat  (not wheat flour) as the first ingredient, and avoid those with other  flour ingredients, such as white flour or corn flour. (Enriched wheat  flour refers to white flour with added vitamins.) Eat less of products  that list HFCS and other sugars such as sucrose, honey, dextrose,  and cane sugar in the first five ingredients.

The 2010 Dietary Guidelines recommends eating  more unrefined carbohydrates and more fiber, and reducing  consumption of foods that are high in added sugars. To accomplish  these recommendations use some or all of the following  suggestions:  • Get more daily carbohydrate servings from whole grains by  eating a whole-grain cereal for breakfast, using whole-grain  bread to make a sandwich for lunch, and eating a serving of  beans and/or nuts with dinner.  • Make sure to get at least three servings (or more) of all the  grains you eat as whole grains every day. A serving of whole  grains is equal to one slice of whole-wheat bread, one ounce of  whole-grain cereal, and one-half cup of cooked cereal, brown  rice, or whole-wheat pasta.  Food products made with cornmeal use the whole grain so  choose tortillas, corn cereals, and corn breads with cornmeal  listed as the first ingredient.  • When baking, substitute whole-wheat flour or other whole- grain flour for some of the refined white flour.  • If you like bread at dinner, choose a whole-grain muffin over a  Kaiser roll or baguette.  Add beans, nuts, or seeds to salad—they add texture and taste.  • Choose whole-grain pastas and brown rice, cook al dente, and  add some beans and vegetables in equal portions.  • Change it up a bit and experience the taste and satisfaction of  other whole grains such as barley, quinoa, and bulgur.  • Eat snacks high in fiber, such as almonds, pistachios, raisins,  and air-popped popcorn.

The Food Industry: Functional Attributes of  Carbohydrates and the Use of Sugar Substitutes  In the food industry, both fast-releasing and slow-releasing  carbohydrates are utilized to give foods a wide spectrum of  functional attributes, including increased sweetness, viscosity, bulk,  coating ability, solubility, consistency, texture, body, and browning  capacity. The differences in chemical structure between the  different carbohydrates confer their varied functional uses in foods.  Starches, gums, and pectins are used as thickening agents in making  jam, cakes, cookies, noodles, canned products, imitation cheeses,  and a variety of other foods. Molecular gastronomists use slow- releasing carbohydrates, such as alginate, to give shape and texture  to their fascinating food creations. Adding fiber to foods increases  bulk. Simple sugars are used not only for adding sweetness, but  also to add texture, consistency, and browning. In ice cream, the  combination of sucrose and corn syrup imparts sweetness as well as  a glossy appearance and smooth texture.  Due to the potential health consequences of consuming too many  added sugars, sugar substitutes have replaced them in many foods  and beverages. Sugar substitutes may be from natural sources or  artificially made. Those that are artificially made are called artificial  sweeteners and must be approved by the FDA for use in foods  and beverages. The artificial sweeteners approved by the FDA are  saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, neotame, advantame,  and sucralose. Stevia is an example of a naturally derived sugar  substitute.

The FDA requires that foods disclose the fact that  they contain sugar alcohols, but does not require scientific testing  of it. (Though many of them have undergone studies anyway.) In  comparison to sucrose, artificial sweeteners are significantly  sweeter (in fact, by several hundred times), but sugar alcohols are  more often less sweet than sucrose (see Table 4.5 “Relative  Sweetness of Sugar Substitutes”).

Artificial sweeteners are basically non-nutrients  though not all are completely calorie-free. However, because they  are so intense in sweetness they are added in very small amounts  to foods and beverages. Artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols are  not “fermentable sugars” and therefore they do not cause tooth  decay. Chewing gum with artificial sweeteners is the only proven  way that artificial sweeteners promote oral health. The American  Dental Association (ADA) allows manufacturers of chewing gum to  label packages with an ADA seal if they have convincing scientific  evidence demonstrating their product either reduces plaque acids,  cavities, or gum disease, or promotes tooth remineralization.  There is limited scientific evidence that consuming products with  artificial sweeteners decreases weight. In fact, some studies suggest  the intense sweetness of these products increases appetite for  sweet foods and may lead to increased weight gain. Also, there  is very limited evidence that suggests artificial sweeteners lower  blood-glucose levels. Additionally, many foods and beverages  containing artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols are still empty- calorie foods (i.e. chewing sugarless gum or drinking diet soda pop)  are not going to better your blood-glucose levels or your health.

The health concerns of sugar substitutes  originally  stemmed  from  scientific  studies,  which  were  misinterpreted by both scientists and the public.  In the early 1970s scientific studies were published that  demonstrated that high doses of saccharin caused bladder tumors  in rats. This information fueled the still-ongoing debate of the  health consequences of all artificial sweeteners. In actuality, the  results from the early studies were completely irrelevant to humans.  The large doses (2.5 percent of diet) of saccharine caused a pellet  to form in the rat’s bladder. That pellet chronically irritated the  bladder wall, eventually resulting in tumor development. Since this  study, scientific investigation in rats, monkeys, and humans have  not found any relationship between saccharine consumption and  bladder cancer. In 2000, saccharin was removed from the US  National Toxicology Program’s list of potential carcinogens.1  There have been health concerns over other artificial sweeteners,  most notably aspartame (sold under the trade names of NutraSweet  and Equal). The first misconception regarding aspartame was that  it was linked with an increase in the incidence of brain tumors in  the United States. It was subsequently discovered that the increase  in brain tumors started eight years prior to the introduction of  aspartame to the market. Today, aspartame is accused of causing  brain damage, autism, emotional disorders, and a myriad of other  disorders and diseases.

So, normal fat reserves are a signal that metabolic processes  are efficient and a person is healthy.  Lipids are a family of organic compounds that are mostly insoluble  in water. Composed of fats and oils, lipids are molecules that yield  high energy and have a chemical composition mainly of carbon,  hydrogen, and oxygen. Lipids perform three primary biological  functions within the body: they serve as structural components of  cell membranes, function as energy storehouses, and function as  important signaling molecules.  The three main types of lipids are triglycerides, phospholipids,  and sterols. Triglycerides make up more than 95 percent of lipids  in the diet and are commonly found in fried foods, vegetable oil,  butter, whole milk, cheese, cream cheese, and some meats.  Naturally occurring triglycerides are found in many foods, including  avocados, olives, corn, and nuts. We commonly call the triglycerides  in our food “fats” and “oils.” Fats are lipids that are solid at room  temperature, whereas oils are liquid. As with most fats, triglycerides  do not dissolve in water. The terms fats, oils, and triglycerides are  discretionary and can be used interchangeably. In this chapter when  we use the word fat, we are referring to triglycerides.  Phospholipids make up only about 2 percent of dietary lipids.  They are water-soluble and are found in both plants and animals.  Phospholipids are crucial for building the protective barrier, or  membrane, around your body’s cells. In fact, phospholipids are  synthesized in the body to form cell and organelle membranes. In  blood and body fluids, phospholipids form structures in which fat is  enclosed and transported throughout the bloodstream.  Sterols are the least common type of lipid. Cholesterol is perhaps  the best well-known sterol. Though cholesterol has a notorious  reputation, the body gets only a small amount of its cholesterol  through food—the body produces most of it. Cholesterol is an  important component of the cell membrane and is required for the  synthesis of sex hormones, and bile salts.  Introduction  |  293'},\n",

Most of the energy  required by the human body is provided by carbohydrates and  lipids. As discussed in the Carbohydrates chapter, glucose is stored  in the body as glycogen. While glycogen provides a ready source of  energy, lipids primarily function as an energy reserve. As you may  recall, glycogen is quite bulky with heavy water content, thus the  body cannot store too much for long. Alternatively, fats are packed  together tightly without water and store far greater amounts of  energy in a reduced space. A fat gram is densely concentrated with  energy—it contains more than double the amount of energy than a  gram of carbohydrate. Energy is needed to power the muscles for  all the physical work and play an average person or child engages in.  For instance, the stored energy in muscles propels an athlete down  the track, spurs a dancer’s legs to showcase the latest fancy steps,  and keeps all the moving parts of the body functioning smoothly.  Unlike other body cells that can store fat in limited supplies, fat  cells are specialized for fat storage and are able to expand almost  indefinitely in size. An overabundance of adipose tissue can result  in undue stress on the body and can be detrimental to your health.  A serious impact of excess fat is the accumulation of too much  cholesterol in the arterial wall, which can thicken the walls of  arteries and lead to cardiovascular disease.

It also gives the body the extra padding  required when engaging in physically demanding activities such as  ice- or roller skating, horseback riding, or snowboarding.  Aiding Digestion and Increasing Bioavailability  The dietary fats in the foods we eat break down in our digestive  systems and begin the transport of precious micronutrients. By  carrying fat-soluble nutrients through the digestive process,  intestinal absorption is improved. This improved absorption is also  known as increased bioavailability. Fat-soluble nutrients are  especially important for good health and exhibit a variety of  functions. Vitamins A, D, E, and K—the fat-soluble vitamins—are  mainly found in foods containing fat. Some fat-soluble vitamins  (such as vitamin A) are also found in naturally fat-free foods such  as green leafy vegetables, carrots, and broccoli. These vitamins are  best absorbed when combined with foods containing fat. Fats also  increase the bioavailability of compounds known as phytochemicals,  which are plant constituents such as lycopene (found in tomatoes)  and beta-carotene (found in carrots). Phytochemicals are believed  to promote health and well-being. As a result, eating tomatoes with  olive oil or salad dressing will facilitate lycopene absorption. Other  essential nutrients, such as essential fatty acids, are constituents of  the fats themselves and serve as building blocks of a cell.

Foods that are  high in fat contain more calories than foods high in protein or  carbohydrates. As a result, high-fat foods are a convenient source  of energy. For example, 1 gram of fat or oil provides 9 kilocalories  of energy, compared with 4 kilocalories found in 1 gram of  carbohydrate or protein. Depending on the level of physical activity  and on nutritional needs, fat requirements vary greatly from person  to person. When energy needs are high, the body welcomes the  high-caloric density of fats. For instance, infants and growing  children require proper amounts of fat to support normal growth  and development. If an infant or child is given a low-fat diet for  an extended period, growth and development will not progress  normally. Other individuals with high-energy needs are athletes,  people who have physically demanding jobs, and those recuperating  from illness.  When the body has used all of its calories from carbohydrates  (this can occur after just twenty minutes of exercise), it initiates  fat usage. A professional swimmer must consume large amounts of  food energy to meet the demands of swimming long distances, so  eating fat-rich foods makes sense. In contrast, if a person who leads  a sedentary lifestyle eats the same high-density fat foods, they will  intake more fat calories than their body requires within just a few  bites. Use caution—consumption of calories over and beyond energy  requirements is a contributing factor to obesity.  The Role of Lipids in Food  |  301'},\n",

What would a meal be without that savory  aroma to delight your senses and heighten your preparedness for  eating a meal?  Fat plays another valuable role in nutrition. Fat contributes to  satiety, or the sensation of fullness. When fatty foods are swallowed  the body responds by enabling the processes controlling digestion  to retard the movement of food along the digestive tract, thus  promoting an overall sense of fullness. Oftentimes before the feeling  of fullness arrives, people overindulge in fat-rich foods, finding the  delectable taste irresistible.

The term saturation refers  to whether or not a fatty acid chain is filled (or “saturated”) to  capacity with hydrogen atoms. If each available carbon bond holds  a hydrogen atom we call this a saturated fatty acid chain. All carbon  atoms in such a fatty acid chain are bonded with single bonds.  Sometimes the chain has a place where hydrogen atoms are missing.  This is referred to as the point of unsaturation.  When one or more bonds between carbon atoms are a double  bond (C=C), that fatty acid is called an unsaturated fatty acid, as  it has one or more points of unsaturation. Any fatty acid that has  only one double bond is a monounsaturated fatty acid, an example  of which is olive oil (75 percent of its fat is monounsaturated).

Foods rich in unsaturated fatty  acids, such as olive oil (oleic acid, an eighteen-carbon unsaturated  fatty acid, is a major component) tend to be liquid at room  temperature. Flaxseed oil is rich in alpha-linolenic acid, which is  an unsaturated fatty acid and becomes a thin liquid at room  temperature.

Since most of our digestive enzymes are water- based, how does the body break down fat and make it available for  the various functions it must perform in the human body?  From the Mouth to the Stomach  The first step in the digestion of triglycerides and phospholipids  begins in the mouth as lipids encounter saliva. Next, the physical  action of chewing coupled with the action of emulsifiers enables the  digestive enzymes to do their tasks. The enzyme lingual lipase, along  with a small amount of phospholipid as an emulsifier, initiates the  process of digestion. These actions cause the fats to become more  accessible to the digestive enzymes. As a result, the fats become tiny  droplets and separate from the watery components.

Emulsification increases the surface area of lipids over a thousand- fold, making them more accessible to the digestive enzymes.  Once the stomach contents have been emulsified, fat-breaking  enzymes work on the triglycerides and diglycerides to sever fatty  acids from their glycerol foundations. As pancreatic lipase enters  the small intestine, it breaks down the fats into free fatty acids  and monoglycerides. Yet again, another hurdle presents itself. How  will the fats pass through the watery layer of mucus that coats  the absorptive lining of the digestive tract? As before, the answer  is bile.

When  the muscles reach their capacity for glycogen storage, the excess  is returned to the liver, where it is converted into triglycerides and  then stored as fat.  In a similar manner, much of the triglycerides the body receives  from food is transported to fat storehouses within the body if not  used for producing energy. The chylomicrons are responsible for  shuttling the triglycerides to various locations such as the muscles,  breasts, external layers under the skin, and internal fat layers of the  abdomen, thighs, and buttocks where they are stored by the body  in adipose tissue for future use. How is this accomplished? Recall  that chylomicrons are large lipoproteins that contain a triglyceride  and fatty-acid core. Capillary walls contain an enzyme called  lipoprotein-lipase  that  dismantles  the  triglycerides  in  the  lipoproteins into fatty acids and glycerol, thus enabling these to  enter into the adipose cells. Once inside the adipose cells, the fatty  acids and glycerol are reassembled into triglycerides and stored for  later use. Muscle cells may also take up the fatty acids and use them  for muscular work and generating energy. When a person’s energy  requirements exceed the amount of available fuel presented from a  recent meal or extended physical activity has exhausted glycogen  energy reserves, fat reserves are retrieved for energy utilization.  As the body calls for additional energy, the adipose tissue  responds by dismantling its triglycerides and dispensing glycerol  and fatty acids directly into the blood. Upon receipt of these  substances the energy-hungry cells break them down further into  tiny fragments. These fragments go through a series of chemical  reactions that yield energy, carbon dioxide, and water.  Figure 5.14 Storing and Using Fat  324  |  Digestion and Absorption of Lipids'},\n",

Following is  a list of the various lipoproteins and their functions:  • VLDLs. Very low-density lipoproteins are made in the liver  from remnants of chylomicrons and transport triglycerides  from the liver to various tissues in the body. As the VLDLs  travel through the circulatory system, the lipoprotein lipase  strips the VLDL of triglycerides. As triglyceride removal  persists, the VLDLs become intermediate-density lipoproteins.  • IDLs. Intermediate-density lipoproteins transport a variety of  fats and cholesterol in the bloodstream and are a little under  half triglyceride in composition. While travelling in the  bloodstream, cholesterol is gained from other lipoproteins  while circulating enzymes strip its phospholipid component.  When IDLs return to the liver, they are transformed into low- density lipoprotein.  • LDLs. As low-density lipoproteins are commonly known as the  “bad cholesterol” it is imperative that we understand their  function in the body so as to make healthy dietary and lifestyle  choices. LDLs carry cholesterol and other lipids from the liver  to tissue throughout the body. LDLs are comprised of very  small amounts of triglycerides, and house over 50 percent  cholesterol and cholesterol esters. How does the body receive  the lipids contained therein? As the LDLs deliver cholesterol  and other lipids to the cells, each cell’s surface has receptor  systems specifically designed to bind with LDLs. Circulating  LDLs in the bloodstream bind to these LDL receptors and are  consumed. Once inside the cell, the LDL is taken apart and its  cholesterol is released. In liver cells these receptor systems aid  in controlling blood cholesterol levels as they bind the LDLs. A  deficiency of these LDL binding mechanisms will leave a high  quantity of cholesterol traveling in the bloodstream, which can  lead to heart disease or atherosclerosis. Diets rich in saturated  fats will prohibit the LDL receptors which, are critical for  326  |  Digestion and Absorption of Lipids'},\n",

Like linolenic acid, the body uses linoleic  acid to make other important substances such as arachidonic  acid (ARA) that is used to make eicosanoids. Recall that  eicosanoids perform critical roles in the body as they affect a  broad spectrum of functions. The word eicosanoid originates  from the Greek word eicosa, meaning twenty, because this  hormone is derived from ARA that is twenty carbon atoms in  length.

Attain the Omega-3 and Omega-6 Balance  As our food choices evolve, the sources of omega-6 fatty acids  in our diets are increasing at a much faster rate than sources of  omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s are plentiful in diets of non- processed foods where grazing animals and foraging chickens roam  free, eating grass, clover, alfalfa, and grass-dwelling insects. In  contrast, today’s western diets are bombarded with sources of  omega-6. For example, we have oils derived from seeds and nuts  and from the meat of animals that are fed grain. Vegetable oils used  in fast-food preparations, most snack-foods, cookies, crackers, and  sweet treats are also loaded with omega-6 fatty acids. Also, our  bodies synthesize eicosanoids from omega-6 fatty acids and these  tend to increase inflammation, blood clotting, and cell proliferation,  while the hormones synthesized from omega-3 fatty acids have just  the opposite effect.  While omega-6 fatty acids are essential, they can be harmful  when they are out of balance with omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-6  fats are required only in small quantities. Researchers believe that  when omega-6 fats are out of balance with omega-3 fats in the  diet they diminish the effects of omega-3 fats and their benefits.

Do you think of heart disease, heart health, or  atherosclerosis? Most people probably do not. As we uncover what  hydrogenation is and why manufacturers use it, you will be better  equipped to adhere to healthier dietary choices and promote your  heart health.  Hydrogenation: The Good Gone Bad?  Food manufacturers are aware that fatty acids are susceptible to  attack by oxygen molecules because their points of unsaturation  render them vulnerable in this regard. When oxygen molecules  attack these points of unsaturation the modified fatty acid becomes  oxidized. The oxidation of fatty acids makes the oil rancid and gives  the food prepared with it an unappetizing taste. Because oils can  undergo oxidation when stored in open containers, they must be  stored in airtight containers and possibly be refrigerated to  minimize damage from oxidation. Hydrogenation poses a solution  that food manufacturers prefer.  When lipids are subjected to hydrogenation, the molecular  structure of the fat is altered. Hydrogenation is the process of  adding hydrogen to unsaturated fatty-acid chains, so that the  hydrogen atoms are connected to the points of saturation and  results in a more saturated fatty acid. Liquid oils that once  contained more unsaturated fatty acids become semisolid or solid  (upon complete hydrogenation) and behave like saturated fats.

When the process of  hydrogenation is not complete, for example, not all carbon double  bonds have been saturated the end result is a partially hydrogenated  oil. The resulting oil is not fully solid. Total hydrogenation makes  the oil very hard and virtually unusable. Some newer products are  now using fully hydrogenated oil combined with nonhydrogenated  vegetable oils to create a usable fat.  Manufacturers favor hydrogenation as a way to prevent oxidation  of oils and ensure longer shelf life. Partially hydrogenated vegetable  oils are used in the fast food and processed food industries because  they impart the desired texture and crispness to baked and fried  foods. Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are more resistant to  breakdown from extremely hot cooking temperatures. Because  hydrogenated oils have a high smoking point they are very well  suited for frying. In addition, processed vegetable oils are cheaper  than fats obtained from animal sources, making them a popular  choice for the food industry.  Trans fatty acids occur in small amounts in nature, mostly in  dairy products. However, the trans fats that are used by the food  industry are produced from the hydrogenation process. Trans fats  are a result of the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids,  which cause them to have a trans configuration, rather than the  naturally occurring cis configuration.  Health Implications of Trans Fats  No trans fats! Zero trans fats! We see these advertisements on a  regular basis. So widespread is the concern over the issue that  restaurants, food manufacturers, and even fast-food establishments  proudly tout either the absence or the reduction of these fats within  their products.

Trans fats are used in many processed foods such as  cookies, cakes, chips, doughnuts, and snack foods to give them their  crispy texture and increased shelf life. However, because trans fats  can behave like saturated fats, the body processes them as if they  were saturated fats. Consuming large amounts of trans fats has been  associated with tissue inflammation throughout the body, insulin  resistance in some people, weight gain, and digestive troubles. In  addition, the hydrogenation process robs the person of the benefits  of consuming the original oil because hydrogenation destroys  omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. The AHA states that, like  saturated fats, trans fats raise LDL “bad cholesterol,” but unlike  saturated fats, trans fats lower HDL “good cholesterol.” The AHA  advises limiting trans-fat consumption to less than 1 percent.  How can you benefit from this information? When selecting your  foods, steer clear of anything that says “hydrogenated,” “fractionally  hydrogenated,” or “partially hydrogenated,” and read food labels in  the following categories carefully:  • cookies, crackers, cakes, muffins, pie crusts, pizza dough, and  breads  • stick margarines and vegetable shortening  • premixed cake mixes, pancake mixes, and drink mixes  • fried foods and hard taco shells  • snack foods (such as chips), candy, and frozen dinners  Choose brands that don’t use trans fats and that are low in saturated  fats.  342  |  Lipids and the Food Industry'},\n",

Over time the  arteries thicken and harden with plaque buildup, causing  restricted or at times low or no blood flow to selected areas of  the body.  • Heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to a  section of the heart is cut off due to a blood clot. Many have  survived heart attacks and go on to return to their lives and  enjoy many more years of life on this earth. However, dietary  and lifestyle changes must be implemented to prevent further  attacks.  • Ischemic stroke.

Limiting the intake of saturated fats and trans fats,  increasing physical activity, and eating fewer calories are all  equally important in this fight against obesity.  What You Can Do  Remember that saturated fats are found in large amounts in foods  of animal origin. They should be limited within the diet.  Polyunsaturated fats are generally obtained from non-animal  sources. While they are beneficial for lowering bad cholesterol they  also lower good cholesterol. They are better for you than saturated  fats but are not to be consumed in excess. Monounsaturated fats  are of plant origin and are found in most nuts, seeds, seed oils, olive  oil, canola oil, and legumes. Monounsaturated fats are excellent  because they not only lower bad cholesterol, but also they elevate  the good cholesterol. Replace current dietary fats with an increased  intake of monounsaturated fats.  Choose whole-grain and high-fiber foods. Reduced risk for  cardiovascular disease has been associated with diets that are high  in whole grains and fiber. Fiber also slows down cholesterol  absorption. The AHA recommends that at least half of daily grain  intake should originate from whole grains. The Adequate Intake  value for fiber is 14 grams per 1,000 kilocalories. These amounts  are based upon the amount of fiber that has been shown to reduce  cardiovascular risk.  Do not be sedentary. Get more exercise on a regular basis.  Increasing your energy expenditure by just twenty minutes of  physical activity at least three times per week will improve your  overall health. Physical exercise can help you manage or prevent  high blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. Regular activity  raises HDL while at the same time decreases triglycerides and  plaque buildup in the arteries. Calories are burned consistently,  Lipids and Disease  |  349'},\n",

Create a shopping list and divide your  list into columns for “Best,” “Better,” “Good,” “Least Desirable,” and  “Infrequent Foods.” As you refine your sense of dietary fat, here are  key points to bear in mind:  • Shopping for groceries. Don’t be bombarded with gratuitous  grams of saturated fats and empty grams of trans fats. Read  and decipher food labels carefully so that you know exactly  what types of fat a food item contains and how much fat it will  contribute to your overall fat intake. For snacks and daily  eating, gravitate toward foods that are lowest in or absent of  harmful trans fats. Restrict other foods to occasional usage  based upon their fat content. For example, if selecting  prepared foods, choose the ones without high-fat sauces in  favor of adding your own flavorings. If selecting precooked  meats, avoid those that are fried, coated, or prepared in high- fat sauces. A popular and healthy precooked meat food choice  is the rotisserie chicken that most supermarkets carry. When  selecting meats be aware of the need to compare different  cuts—notice their fat content, color, and marbling. Higher-fat  meats tend to have whiter fat marbled throughout.

Saturated and trans fats are not good for you and  must be placed in your “Least Desirable” column because they  increase cholesterol levels and put you at risk for heart  disease. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are better  choices to replace these undesirable fats. The key in  identifying the “Best” or “Better” fats from the “Least Desirable”  fats while you shop is based upon appearance. When choosing  fats remember that saturated fats and trans fats are solid at  room temperature; think of butter. Monounsaturated and  polyunsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature; think of  vegetable oil.  • Try to eliminate as much trans fat as possible from your food  selections. Avoid commercially baked goods and fast foods.  Make these your “Infrequent Foods.”  • Choose unsaturated fats. Fatty fish, walnuts, flaxseeds,  flaxseed oil, and canola oil all have good health benefits and  should be on the “Best,” “Better,” and “Good” fat lists. They each  provide essential omega-3 fatty acids necessary for overall  body health. To derive the most benefit from including these  foods, do not add them to an existing diet full of fat. Use these  to replace the “Least Desirable” fats that are being removed  from the diet.  • Limit saturated fat intake. Reduce red meat consumption,  processed meats, and whole-fat dairy products. To reduce full- fat dairy items try their low-fat or nonfat counterparts such as  mozzarella cheese.  • Low fat does not equal healthy.

Too  much of these ingredients can also cause health problems.  Choose and consume wisely.  • A “better-fat” diet will successfully support weight loss.  While cutting “Least Desirable” fat calories are vital to weight  loss, remember that “Better” fats are filling and just a handful  of nuts can curb an appetite to prevent overeating.  • Consume omega-3 fats each day. For optimal health and  disease prevention include a moderate serving of fish, walnuts,  ground flaxseeds, flaxseed oil, or soybean oil in your diet every  day.  • How much saturated fat is too much? Your goal is to keep  your intake of saturated fat to no more than 10 percent of your  total dietary calories on a daily basis. Thus, it is important to  learn to reduce the intake of foods high in saturated fat. High- fat foods can be consumed but they must fall within the overall  goal for a person’s fat allowance for the day.  • Home cooking. Limit the use of saturated fats in home  preparation of meals. Instead of butter try spreads made from  unsaturated oils such as canola or olive oils and the use of  cooking sprays. Couple this with the use of herbs and spices to  add flavor. Avoid using high-fat meat gravies, cheese, and  cream sauces. Limit adding extras to foods such as butter on a  baked potato. Use nonfat sour cream instead. Grill, bake, stir- fry, roast, or bake your foods. Never fry in solid fats such as  butter or shortening. Marinate foods to be grilled in fruit juices  and herbs. Instead of relying upon commercial salad dressings,  learn to make your own top-quality dressing from cold- pressed olive oil, flaxseed oil, or sesame oil.  • Make sure the fat is flavorful.

The word protein is a Greek word,  meaning “of utmost importance.” Proteins are called the workhorses  of life as they provide the body with structure and perform a vast  array of functions. You can stand, walk, run, skate, swim, and more  because of your protein-rich muscles. Protein is necessary for  proper immune system function, digestion, and hair and nail  growth, and is involved in numerous other body functions. In fact,  it is estimated that more than one hundred thousand different  proteins exist within the human body. In this chapter you will learn  about the components of protein, the important roles that protein  serves within the body, how the body uses protein, the risks and  consequences associated with too much or too little protein, and  where to find healthy sources of it in your diet.  What Is Protein?  Proteins, simply put, are macromolecules composed of amino acids.  Amino acids are commonly called protein’s building blocks. Proteins  are crucial for the nourishment, renewal, and continuance of life.  Proteins contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen just  as carbohydrates and lipids do, but proteins are the only  macronutrient that contains nitrogen. In each amino acid the  elements are arranged into a specific conformation around a carbon  center. Each amino acid consists of a central carbon atom  connected to a side chain, a hydrogen, a nitrogen-containing amino  group, and a carboxylic acid group—hence the name “amino acid.”  Defining Protein  |  363'},\n",

Eleven of these are called nonessential amino acids because  the body can synthesize them. However, nine of the amino acids  are called essential amino acids because we cannot synthesize them  either at all or in sufficient amounts. These must be obtained from  the diet. Sometimes during infancy, growth, and in diseased states  the body cannot synthesize enough of some of the nonessential  amino acids and more of them are required in the diet.

Different proteins are produced  because there are twenty types of naturally occurring amino acids  that are combined in unique sequences to form polypeptides. These  polypeptide chains then fold into a three-dimensional shape to form  a protein (see Figure 6.3 “Formation of Polypeptides”). Additionally,  proteins come in many different sizes. The hormone insulin, which  regulates blood glucose, is composed of only fifty-one amino acids;  whereas collagen, a protein that acts like glue between cells,  consists of more than one thousand amino acids. Titin is the largest  known protein. It accounts for the elasticity of muscles, and consists  of more than twenty-five thousand amino acids!

The first step in  constructing a protein is the transcription (copying) of the genetic  information in double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into  the single-stranded, messenger macromolecule ribonucleic acid  (RNA). RNA is chemically similar to DNA, but has two differences;  one is that its backbone uses the sugar ribose and not deoxyribose;  and two, it contains the nucleotide base uracil, and not thymidine.  The RNA that is transcribed from a given piece of DNA contains the  same information as that DNA, but it is now in a form that can be  read by the cellular protein manufacturer known as the ribosome.  Next, the RNA instructs the cells to gather all the necessary amino  acids and add them to the growing protein chain in a very specific  order. This process is referred to as translation. The decoding of  genetic information to synthesize a protein is the central foundation  of modern biology.  Figure 6.4 Steps for Building a Protein  368  |  Defining Protein'},\n",

The peptide bond forms between the carboxylic acid group of one  amino acid and the amino group of another, releasing a molecule  of water. The third step in protein production involves folding it  into its correct shape. Specific amino acid sequences contain all  the information necessary to spontaneously fold into a particular  shape. A change in the amino acid sequence will cause a change in  protein shape. Each protein in the human body differs in its amino  acid sequence and consequently, its shape. The newly synthesized  protein is structured to perform a particular function in a cell.  A protein made with an incorrectly placed amino acid may not  function properly and this can sometimes cause disease.  Protein Organization  Protein’s structure enables it to perform a variety of functions.  Proteins are similar to carbohydrates and lipids in that they are  polymers of simple repeating units; however, proteins are much  more structurally complex. In contrast to carbohydrates, which  have identical repeating units, proteins are made up of amino acids  that are different from one another. Furthermore, a protein is  organized into four different structural levels.  Primary: The first level is the one-dimensional sequence of amino  acids that are held together by peptide bonds. Carbohydrates and  lipids also are one-dimensional sequences of their respective  monomers, which may be branched, coiled, fibrous, or globular, but  their conformation is much more random and is not organized by  their sequence of monomers.  Secondary: The second level of protein structure is dependent  on the chemical interactions between amino acids, which cause the  protein to fold into a specific shape, such as a helix (like a coiled  spring) or sheet.  370  |  Defining Protein'},\n",

The protein hemoglobin is an example of a  protein that has quaternary structure. It is composed of four  peptides that bond together to form a functional oxygen carrier.  A protein’s structure also influences its nutritional quality. Large  fibrous protein structures are more difficult to digest than smaller  proteins and some, such as keratin, are indigestible. Because  digestion of some fibrous proteins is incomplete, not all of the  amino acids are absorbed and available for the body to utilize,  thereby decreasing their nutritional value.

The  foam bubbles are what give the angel food cake its airy texture.)  Yogurt is another good example of proteins providing texture.

Cooked proteins add some color and flavor to foods as the amino  group binds with carbohydrates and produces a brown pigment and  aroma. Eggs are between 10 and 15 percent protein by weight.

Denaturation  refers to the physical changes that take place in a protein exposed  to abnormal conditions in the environment. Heat, acid, high salt  concentrations, alcohol, and mechanical agitation can cause  proteins to denature. When a protein denatures, its complicated  folded structure unravels, and it becomes just a long strand of  amino acids again. Weak chemical forces that hold tertiary and  secondary protein structures together are broken when a protein  is exposed to unnatural conditions. Because proteins’ function is  dependent on their shape, denatured proteins are no longer  functional. During cooking the applied heat causes proteins to  vibrate. This destroys the weak bonds holding proteins in their  complex shape (though this does not happen to the stronger  peptide bonds).

The teeth begin the  mechanical breakdown of the large egg pieces into smaller pieces  that can be swallowed. The salivary glands provide some saliva to  aid swallowing and the passage of the partially mashed egg through  the esophagus. The mashed egg pieces enter the stomach through  the esophageal sphincter. The stomach releases gastric juices  containing hydrochloric acid and the enzyme, pepsin, which initiate  the breakdown of the protein. The acidity of the stomach facilitates  the unfolding of the proteins that still retain part of their three- dimensional structure after cooking and helps break down the  protein aggregates formed during cooking. Pepsin, which is  secreted by the cells that line the stomach, dismantles the protein  chains into smaller and smaller fragments. Egg proteins are large  globular molecules and their chemical breakdown requires time  and mixing. The powerful mechanical stomach contractions churn  the partially digested protein into a more uniform mixture called  chyme. Protein digestion in the stomach takes a longer time than  carbohydrate digestion, but a shorter time than fat digestion. Eating  a high-protein meal increases the amount of time required to  sufficiently break down the meal in the stomach. Food remains in  the stomach longer, making you feel full longer.  From the Stomach to the Small Intestine  The stomach empties the chyme containing the broken down egg  pieces into the small intestine, where the majority of protein  digestion occurs.

The cells that line the small intestine  release additional enzymes that finally break apart the smaller  protein fragments into the individual amino acids. The muscle  contractions of the small intestine mix and propel the digested  proteins to the absorption sites. In the lower parts of the small  intestine, the amino acids are transported from the intestinal lumen  through the intestinal cells to the blood. This movement of  individual amino acids requires special transport proteins and the  cellular energy molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Once the  amino acids are in the blood, they are transported to the liver. As  with other macronutrients, the liver is the checkpoint for amino  acid distribution and any further breakdown of amino acids, which  is very minimal. Recall that amino acids contain nitrogen, so further  catabolism of amino acids releases nitrogen-containing ammonia.  Because ammonia is toxic, the liver transforms it into urea, which  is then transported to the kidney and excreted in the urine. Urea  is a molecule that contains two nitrogens and is highly soluble in  water. This makes it a good choice for transporting excess nitrogen  out of the body. Because amino acids are building blocks that the  body reserves in order to synthesize other proteins, more than 90  percent of the protein ingested does not get broken down further  than the amino acid monomers.  Amino Acids Are Recycled  Just as some plastics can be recycled to make new products, amino  acids are recycled to make new proteins. All cells in the body  continually break down proteins and build new ones, a process  referred to as protein turnover. Every day over 250 grams of protein  in your body are dismantled and 250 grams of new protein are  built.

On  average, more than one hundred chemical reactions occur in cells  every single second and most of them require enzymes. The liver  alone contains over one thousand enzyme systems. Enzymes are  specific and will use only particular substrates that fit into their  active site, similar to the way a lock can be opened only with a  specific key. Nearly every chemical reaction requires a specific  enzyme. Fortunately, an enzyme can fulfill its role as a catalyst  over and over again, although eventually it is destroyed and rebuilt.  All bodily functions, including the breakdown of nutrients in the  stomach and small intestine, the transformation of nutrients into  molecules a cell can use, and building all macromolecules, including  protein itself, involve enzymes (see Figure 6.10 “Enzymes Role in  Carbohydrate Digestion”).  \\xa0 Figure 6.10 Enzymes Role in Carbohydrate Digestion  Protein’s Functions in the Body  |  385'},\n",

When an  endocrine gland is stimulated, it releases a hormone. The hormone  is then transported in the blood to its target cell, where it  communicates a message to initiate a specific reaction or cellular  process. For instance, after you eat a meal, your blood glucose  levels rise. In response to the increased blood glucose, the pancreas  releases the hormone insulin. Insulin tells the cells of the body that  glucose is available and to take it up from the blood and store it  or use it for making energy or building macromolecules. A major  function of hormones is to turn enzymes on and off, so some  proteins can even regulate the actions of other proteins. While not  all hormones are made from proteins, many of them are.

If too much water in the blood suddenly moves into a tissue, the  results are swelling and, potentially, cell death. Water always flows  from an area of high concentration to one of a low concentration. As  a result, water moves toward areas that have higher concentrations  of other solutes, such as proteins and glucose. To keep the water  evenly distributed between blood and cells, proteins continuously  circulate at high concentrations in the blood. The most abundant  protein in blood is the butterfly-shaped protein known as albumin.  Albumin’s presence in the blood makes the protein concentration in  the blood similar to that in cells. Therefore, fluid exchange between  the blood and cells is not in the extreme, but rather is minimized to  preserve the status quo.

The body has several systems that hold  the blood pH within the normal range to prevent this from  happening. One of these is the circulating albumin. Albumin is  slightly acidic, and because it is negatively charged it balances the  many positively charged molecules, such as protons (H+), calcium,  potassium, and magnesium which are also circulating in the blood.  Albumin acts as a buffer against abrupt changes in the  concentrations of these molecules, thereby balancing blood pH and  maintaining the status quo. The protein hemoglobin also  participates in acid-base balance by binding and releasing protons.  Transport  Albumin and hemoglobin also play a role in molecular transport.  Albumin chemically binds to hormones, fatty acids, some vitamins,  essential minerals, and drugs, and transports them throughout the  circulatory system. Each red blood cell contains millions of  hemoglobin molecules that bind oxygen in the lungs and transport it  to all the tissues in the body. A cell’s plasma membrane is usually not  permeable to large polar molecules, so to get the required nutrients  and molecules into the cell many transport proteins exist in the  cell membrane. Some of these proteins are channels that allow  particular molecules to move in and out of cells. Others act as one- way taxis and require energy to function.

Antibodies also trigger other factors in the  immune system to seek and destroy unwanted intruders.  Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration  Proteins are involved in all aspects of wound healing, a process  that takes place in three phases: inflammatory, proliferative, and  remodeling. For example, if you were sewing and pricked your  finger with a needle, your flesh would turn red and become  inflamed. Within a few seconds bleeding would stop. The healing  process begins with proteins such as bradykinin, which dilate blood  vessels at the site of injury. An additional protein called fibrin helps  to secure platelets that form a clot to stop the bleeding. Next, in  the proliferative phase, cells move in and mend the injured tissue by  installing newly made collagen fibers. The collagen fibers help pull  the wound edges together. In the remodeling phase, more collagen  is deposited, forming a scar. Scar tissue is only about 80 percent  as functional as normal uninjured tissue. If a diet is insufficient in  protein, the process of wound healing is markedly slowed.  While wound healing takes place only after an injury is sustained,  a different process called tissue regeneration is ongoing in the body.  The  main  difference  between  wound  healing  and  tissue  regeneration is in the process of regenerating an exact structural  and functional copy of the lost tissue. Thus, old, dying tissue is  not replaced with scar tissue but with brand new, fully functional  tissue. Some cells (such as skin, hair, nails, and intestinal cells) have  a very high rate of regeneration, while others, (such as heart-muscle  Protein’s Functions in the Body  |  391'},\n",

Tissue regeneration is the creation of new cells (cell division), which  requires many different proteins including enzymes that synthesize  RNA and proteins, transport proteins, hormones, and collagen. In  a hair follicle, cells divide and a hair grows in length. Hair growth  averages 1 centimeter per month and fingernails about 1 centimeter  every one hundred days. The cells lining the intestine regenerate  every three to five days. Protein-inadequate diets impair tissue  regeneration, causing many health problems including impairment  of nutrient digestion and absorption and, most visibly, hair and nail  growth.

A healthy diet  incorporates all nutrients in moderation. Low protein intake has  several health consequences, and a severe lack of protein in the  diet eventually causes death. Although severe protein deficiency is  a rare occurrence in children and adults in the United States, it  is estimated that more than half of the elderly in nursing homes  are protein-deficient. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution  Range (AMDR) for protein for adults is between 10 and 35 percent  of kilocalories, which is a fairly wide range. The percent of protein  in the diet that is associated with malnutrition and its health  consequences is less than 10 percent, but this is often accompanied  by deficiencies in calories and other micronutrients. In this section  we will discuss the health consequences of protein intake that is  either too low to support life’s processes or too high, thereby  increasing the risk of chronic disease. In the last section of this  chapter, we will discuss in more detail the personal choices you can  make to optimize your health by consuming the right amount of  high-quality protein.  Health Consequences of Protein Deficiency  Although severe protein deficiency is rare in the developed world, it  is a leading cause of death in children in many poor, underdeveloped  countries.

The name Kwashiorkor comes  from a language in Ghana and means, “rejected one.” The syndrome  was named because it occurred most commonly in children who  had recently been weaned from the breast, usually because another  child had just been born. Subsequently the child was fed watery  porridge made from low-protein grains, which accounts for the low  protein intake. Kwashiorkor is characterized by swelling (edema) of  the feet and abdomen, poor skin health, growth retardation, low  muscle mass, and liver malfunction. Recall that one of protein’s  functional roles in the body is fluid balance. Diets extremely low  in protein do not provide enough amino acids for the synthesis  of albumin. One of the functions of albumin is to hold water in  the blood vessels, so having lower concentrations of blood albumin  results in water moving out of the blood vessels and into tissues,  causing swelling. The primary symptoms of Kwashiorkor include not  only swelling, but also diarrhea, fatigue, peeling skin, and irritability.  Severe protein deficiency in addition to other micronutrient  deficiencies, such as folate (vitamin B9), iodine, iron, and vitamin C  all contribute to the many health manifestations of this syndrome.

Additionally, there is a scientific hypothesis that there may  be health consequences of remaining on high-protein diets for the  long-term, but clinical trials are ongoing or scheduled to examine  this hypothesis further. As the high-protein diet trend arose so  did the intensely debated issue of whether there are any health  consequences of eating too much protein.

However, diets that include lots of red meat are also high in  saturated fat and cholesterol and sometimes linked to unhealthy  lifestyles, so it is difficult to conclude that the high protein content  is the culprit.  High protein diets appear to only increase the progression of  kidney disease and liver malfunction in people who already have  kidney or liver malfunction, and not to cause these problems.  However, the prevalence of kidney disorders is relatively high and  underdiagnosed.

The  American Heart Association (AHA) states that “High-protein diets  are not recommended because they restrict healthful foods that  provide essential nutrients and do not provide the variety of foods  needed to adequately meet nutritional needs. Individuals who follow  these diets are therefore at risk for compromised vitamin and  mineral intake, as well as potential cardiac, renal, bone, and liver  abnormalities overall.”5  As with any nutrient, protein must be eaten in proper amounts.  Moderation and variety are key strategies to achieving a healthy diet  and need to be considered when optimizing protein intake. While  the scientific community continues its debate about the particulars  regarding the health consequences of too much protein in the diet,  you may be wondering just how much protein you should consume  to be healthy.

Protein Input = Protein Used by the Body + Protein Excreted  The appropriate amount of protein in a person’s diet is that which  maintains a balance between what is taken in and what is used. The  RDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance.  Nitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino  acids. When proteins are broken down and amino acids are  catabolized, nitrogen is released. Remember that when the liver  breaks down amino acids, it produces ammonia, which is rapidly  converted to nontoxic, nitrogen-containing urea, which is then  transported to the kidneys for excretion. Most nitrogen is lost as  urea in the urine, but urea is also excreted in the feces. Proteins are  also lost in sweat and as hair and nails grow. The RDA, therefore,  is the amount of protein a person should consume in their diet to  balance the amount of protein used up and lost from the body. For  healthy adults, this amount of protein was determined to be 0.8  grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. You can calculate  410  |  Proteins, Diet, and Personal Choices'},\n",

The IOM used data from multiple studies that determined  nitrogen balance in people of different age groups to calculate the  RDA for protein. A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the  nitrogen input equals the amount of nitrogen used and excreted. A  person is in negative nitrogen balance when the amount of excreted  nitrogen is greater than that consumed, meaning that the body is  breaking down more protein to meet its demands. This state of  imbalance can occur in people who have certain diseases, such  as cancer or muscular dystrophy. Someone who has a low-protein  diet may also be in negative nitrogen balance as they are taking in  less protein than what they actually need. Positive nitrogen balance  occurs when a person excretes less nitrogen than what is taken  in by the diet, such as during child growth or pregnancy. At these  times the body requires more protein to build new tissues, so more  of what gets consumed gets used up and less nitrogen is excreted. A  person healing from a severe wound may also be in positive nitrogen  balance because protein is being used up to repair tissues.  Dietary Sources of Protein  The protein food group consists of foods made from meat, seafood,  poultry, eggs, soy, dry beans, peas, and seeds. According to the  Harvard School of Public Health, “animal protein and vegetable  protein probably have the same effects on health.

Foods that are complete protein sources  include animal foods such as milk, cheese, eggs, fish, poultry, and  meat, and a few plant foods, such as soy and quinoa.

Because grains  and legumes are not deficient in the same amino acids they can  complement each other in a diet. Incomplete protein foods are  called complementary foods because when consumed in tandem  they contain all nine essential amino acids at adequate levels.

Following a vegetarian diet and getting the  recommended protein intake is also made a little more difficult  because the digestibility of plant-based protein sources is lower  than the digestibility of animal-based protein.  To begin planning a more plant-based diet, start by finding out  which types of food you want to eat and in what amounts you should  eat them to ensure that you get the protein you need. The Dietary  Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) has analyzed how three  different, plant-based dietary patterns can meet the recommended  dietary guidelines for all nutrients.2  The diets are defined in the following manner:  • Plant-based. Fifty percent of protein is obtained from plant  foods.  • Lacto-ovo vegetarian. All animal products except eggs and  dairy are eliminated.  • Vegan. All animal products are eliminated.  These diets are analyzed and compared to the more common  dietary pattern of Americans, which is referred to as the USDA Base  Diet. Table 6.6 “Percentage of “Meat and Beans Group” Components  in the USDA Base Diet, and Three Vegetarian Variations” and Table  7.7 “Proportions of Milk Products and Calcium-Fortified Soy  Products in the Base USDA Patterns and Three Vegetarian  Variations” can be used to help determine what percentage of  certain foods to eat when following a different dietary pattern.

To avert excessive borrowing of amino acids from muscle tissue to  synthesize energy during prolonged exercise, protein needs to be  obtained from the diet. Intense exercise, such as strength training,  stresses muscle tissue so that afterward, the body adapts by  building bigger, stronger, and healthier muscle tissue. The body  requires protein post-exercise to accomplish this.

Nutrition experts also recommend that athletes consume some  protein within one hour after exercise to enhance muscle tissue  repair during the recovery phase, but some carbohydrates and  water should be consumed as well.

There are two scientific schools of  thought on this matter. One side believes athletes need more  protein and the other thinks the protein requirements of athletes  are the same as for nonathletes. There is scientific evidence to  support both sides of this debate. The consensus of both sides is  that few people exercise at the intensity that makes this debate  relevant.

For thousands of years, alcohol has been consumed in a medicinal,  celebratory, and ritualistic manner. It is drunk in just about every  country and often in excessive amounts. Alcohol can be made from  a variety of different starch foods through the processes called  fermentation. Fermentation of a starchy food such as barley or  wheat can produce ethanol and CO2 which makes up what is  commonly known as beer. The Native Hawaiians distilled a mash of  fermented ti roots in iron try-pots pre-colonization in the 1700s.  This form of alcohol was called “Okolehao”. This alcoholic beverage  more commonly known today as “moonshine”, is still made locally in  the islands today.1  Alcohol is a psychoactive drug. A psychoactive drug is any  substance that crosses the blood-brain barrier primarily affecting  the functioning of the brain, be it altering mood, thinking, memory,  motor control, or behavior.

However, alcohol displays its two-faced  character again in its effects on body weight, making many scientific  studies contradictory. Multiple studies show high intakes of hard  liquor are linked to weight gain, although this may be the result  of the regular consumption of hard liquor with sugary soft drinks,  juices, and other mixers. On the other hand drinking beer and, even  more so, red wine, is not consistently linked to weight gain and  in some studies actually decreases weight gain. The contradictory  results of scientific studies that have examined the association of  alcohol intake with body weight are partly due to the fact that  alcohol contributes calories to the diet. When alcohol is drunk in  excess, it reduces the secretion of pancreatic juice and damages the  lining of the gastrointestinal system, impairing nutrient digestion  and absorption. The impaired digestion and absorption of nutrients  in alcoholics contributes to their characteristic “skinniness” and  multiple associated micronutrient deficiencies. The most common  macronutrient deficiency among alcoholics is water, as it is  excreted  in  excess.  Commonly  associated  micronutrient  deficiencies include thiamine, pyridoxine, folate, vitamin A,  magnesium, calcium, and zinc. Furthermore, alcoholics typically  replace calories from alcohol with those of nutritious foods,  sometimes getting 50 percent or more of their daily caloric intake  from alcoholic beverages.  442  |  Health Consequences of Alcohol Abuse'},\n",

As more alcohol is ingested, this  stimulates the production of acetaldehyde by both the alcohol  dehydrogenase and MEOS systems. As the levels of acetaldehyde  increase inside the liver cells with heavy consumption of alcohol,  some of the acetaldehyde diffuse into the blood circulation. In  circulation, high levels of acetaldehyde cause nausea and vomiting.  Vomiting causes more body dehydration and loss of electrolytes.  If the dehydration becomes severe enough, this can impair brain  function and a person may lose consciousness.  Alcohol can adversely affect nearly every area of the brain. When  BAC rises, the central nervous system is depressed. Alcohol disrupts  the way nerve cells communicate with each other by interfering  with receptors on certain cells. The immediate impact of alcohol  on the brain can be seen in the awkwardly displayed symptoms  of confusion, blurred vision, slurred speech, and other signs of  intoxication. These symptoms will go away once drinking stops,  but abusive alcohol consumption over time can lead to long-lasting  damage to the brain and nervous system. This is because alcohol  and its metabolic byproducts kill brain cells.  Effects of Excessive Alcohol on the Liver  Alcohol stimulates the release of epinephrine from the kidneys.

Strictly speaking, cirrhosis cannot be cured. It can,  however, be stopped with medical treatment and  complications can be managed if the individual stops drinking,  and many do survive. Not all cases of cirrhosis are strictly due  to alcoholism, and not all alcoholics develop the disease.

Moreover,  there is some scientific evidence that moderate alcohol intake  reduces the risk for metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, and  gallstones.

Normal function of the human body  requires a constant input and output of energy to maintain life.  Various chemical components of food provide the input of energy to  the body. The chemical breakdown of those chemicals provides the  energy needed to carry out thousands of body functions that allow  the body to perform daily functions and tasks such as breathing,  walking up a flight of steps, and studying for a test.  Energy is classified as either potential or kinetic. Potential energy  is stored energy, or energy waiting to happen. Kinetic energy is  energy in motion. To illustrate this, think of an Olympic swimmer  standing at the pool’s edge awaiting the sound of the whistle to  begin the race. While he waits for the signal, he has potential  energy. When the whistle sounds and he dives into the pool and  begins to swim, his energy is kinetic (in motion).  In food and in components of the human body, potential energy  resides in the chemical bonds of specific molecules such as  carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and alcohol. This potential energy is  converted into kinetic energy in the body that drives many body  functions ranging from muscle and nerve function to driving the  synthesis of body protein for growth. After potential energy is  released to provide kinetic energy, it ultimately becomes thermal  energy or heat. You can notice this when you exercise and your  body heats up.  The Calorie Is a Unit of Energy  The amount of energy in nutrients or the amount of energy  expended by the body can be quantified with a variety of units  used to measure energy. In the US, the kilocalorie (kcal) is most  commonly used and is often just referred to as a calorie. Strictly  speaking, a kcal is 1000 calories.

Sometimes the kcal is indicated by  capitalizing calories as “Calories.”\\xa0 A kilocalorie is the amount of  energy in the form of heat that is required to heat one kilogram of  water one degree Celsius.  Most other countries use the kilojoule (kJ) as their standard unit  of energy. The Joule is a measure of energy based on work  accomplished – the energy needed to produce a specific amount of  force. Since calories and Joules are both measures of energy, one  can be converted to the other – 1 kcal = 4.18 kJ.  Estimating Caloric Content  The energy contained in energy-yielding nutrients differs because  the energy-yielding nutrients are composed of different types of  chemical bonds. The carbohydrate or protein in a food yields  approximately 4 kilocalories per gram, whereas the triglycerides  that compose the fat in a food yield 9 kilocalories per gram. A  kilocalorie of energy performs one thousand times more work than  a calorie. On the Nutrition Facts panel found on packaged food, the  calories listed for a particular food are actually kilocalories.  Estimating the number of calories in commercially prepared food  is fairly easy since the total number of calories in a serving of a  particular food is listed on the Nutrition Facts panel. If you wanted  to know the number of calories in the breakfast you consumed  this morning just add up the number of calories in each food. For  example, if you ate one serving of yogurt that contained 150 calories,  on which you sprinkled half of a cup of low-fat granola cereal that  contained 209 calories, and drank a glass of orange juice that  contained 100 calories, the total number of calories you consumed  at breakfast is 150 + 209 + 100 = 459 calories. If you do not have  a Nutrition Facts panel for a certain food, such as a half cup of  blueberries, and want to find out the amount of calories it contains,  go to Food-a-pedia, a website maintained by the USDA.

An Organism Requires Energy and Nutrient  Input  Energy is required in order to build molecules into larger  macromolecules (like proteins), and to turn macromolecules into  organelles and cells, which then turn into tissues, organs, and organ  systems, and finally into an organism. Proper nutrition provides  the necessary nutrients to make the energy that supports life’s  processes. Your body builds new macromolecules from the  nutrients in food.  Nutrient and Energy Flow  Energy is stored in a nutrient’s chemical bonds. Energy comes from  sunlight, which plants capture and, via photosynthesis, use it to  transform carbon dioxide in the air into the molecule glucose. When  the glucose bonds are broken, energy is released. Bacteria, plants,  and animals (including humans) harvest the energy in glucose via a  biological process called cellular respiration. In this process oxygen  is required and the chemical energy of glucose is gradually released  in a series of chemical reactions. Some of this energy is trapped  in the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and some is lost as  heat. ATP can be used when needed to drive chemical reactions in  cells that require an input of energy. Cellular respiration requires  oxygen (aerobic) and it is provided as a byproduct of photosynthesis.  The byproducts of cellular respiration are carbon dioxide (CO2) and  water, which plants use to conduct photosynthesis again. Thus,  carbon is constantly cycling between plants and animals.

Food Quality  One measurement of food quality is the amount of nutrients it  contains relative to the amount of energy it provides. High-quality  foods are nutrient dense, meaning they contain lots of nutrients  relative to the amount of calories they provide. Nutrient-dense  foods are the opposite of “empty-calorie” foods such as carbonated  sugary soft drinks, which provide many calories and very little, if  any, other nutrients. Food quality is additionally associated with  its taste, texture, appearance, microbial content, and how much  consumers like it.  458  |  Introduction'},\n",

The structural  elements of an atom are protons (positively charged), neutrons (no  charge), and electrons (negatively charged). Protons and neutrons  are contained in the dense nucleus of the atom; the nucleus thus has  a positive charge. Because opposites attract, electrons are attracted  to this nucleus and move around it in the electron cloud.  Electrons contain energy, and this energy is stored within the  charge and movement of electrons and the bonds atoms make with  one another. However, this energy is not always stable, depending  on the number of electrons within an atom. Atoms are more stable  when their electrons orbit in pairs. An atom with an odd number  of electrons must have an unpaired electron. In most cases, these  unpaired electrons are used to create chemical bonds. A chemical  bond is the attractive force between atoms and contains potential  energy. By bonding, electrons find pairs and chemicals become part  of a molecule.  Bond formation and bond breaking are chemical reactions that  involve the movement of electrons between atoms. These chemical  reactions occur continuously in the body. We previously reviewed  how glucose breaks down into water and carbon dioxide as part of  cellular respiration. The energy released by breaking those bonds  is used to form molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Recall  how during this process electrons are extracted from glucose in a  stepwise manner and transferred to other molecules. Occasionally  electrons “escape” and, instead of completing the cellular  respiration cycle, are transferred to an oxygen molecule.

As this chain  reaction continues, the permeability and fluidity of cell membranes  changes, proteins in cell membranes experience decreased activity,  and receptor proteins undergo changes in structure that either alter  or stop their function.

Metabolism is either categorized as catabolism, referring to all  metabolic processes involved in molecule breakdown, or anabolism,  which includes all metabolic processes involved in building bigger  molecules. Generally, catabolic processes release energy and  anabolic processes consume energy. The overall goals of  metabolism are energy transfer and matter transport. Energy is  transformed from food macronutrients into cellular energy, which  is used to perform cellular work. Metabolism transforms the matter  of macronutrients into substances a cell can use to grow and  reproduce and also into waste products. For example, enzymes are  proteins and their job is to catalyze chemical reactions. Catalyze  means to speed-up a chemical reaction and reduce the energy  required to complete the chemical reaction, without the catalyst  being used up in the reaction. Without enzymes, chemical reactions  would not happen at a fast enough rate and would use up too  much energy for life to exist. A metabolic pathway is a series of  enzyme catalyzed reactions that transform the starting material  (known as a substrate) into intermediates, that are the substrates  for subsequent enzymatic reactions in the pathway, until, finally,  an end product is synthesized by the last enzymatic reaction in  the pathway. Some metabolic pathways are complex and involve  many enzymatic reactions, and others involve only a few chemical  reactions.  To ensure cellular efficiency, the metabolic pathways involved in  catabolism and anabolism are regulated in concert by energy status,  hormones, and substrate and end-product levels. The concerted  regulation of metabolic pathways prevents cells from inefficiently  building a molecule when it is already available.

Catabolism of food molecules begins when food enters the mouth,  as the enzyme salivary amylase initiates the breakdown of the starch  in foods. The entire process of digestion converts the large  polymers in food to monomers that can be absorbed. Starches are  broken down to monosaccharides, lipids are broken down to fatty  acids, and proteins are broken down to amino acids. These  monomers are absorbed into the bloodstream either directly, as is  the case with monosaccharides and amino acids, or repackaged in  intestinal cells for transport by an indirect route through lymphatic  vessels, as is the case with most fatty acids and other fat-soluble  molecules.  Once absorbed, water-soluble nutrients first travel to the liver  which controls their passage into the blood that transports the  nutrients to cells throughout the body. The fat-soluble nutrients  gradually pass from the lymphatic vessels into blood flowing to body  cells. Cells requiring energy or building blocks take up the nutrients  from the blood and process them in either catabolic or anabolic  pathways. The organ systems of the body require fuel and building  blocks to perform the many functions of the body, such as digesting,  absorbing, breathing, pumping blood, transporting nutrients in and  wastes out, maintaining body temperature, and making new cells.

Electron Transport Chain and ATP synthesis  Figure 8.4 ATP Production Pathway  The breakdown of glucose begins with glycolysis, which is a ten- step metabolic pathway yielding two ATP per glucose molecule;  glycolysis takes place in the cytosol and does not require oxygen. In  addition to ATP, the end-products of glycolysis include two three- carbon molecules, called pyruvate. Pyruvate can either be shuttled  to the citric acid cycle to make more ATP or follow an anabolic  pathway. If a cell is in negative-energy balance, pyruvate is  transported to the mitochondria where it first gets one of its  carbons chopped off, yielding acetyl-CoA. The breakdown of fatty  acids begins with the catabolic pathway, known as β-oxidation,  which takes place in the mitochondria. In this catabolic pathway,  four enzymatic steps sequentially remove two-carbon molecules  from long chains of fatty acids, yielding acetyl-CoA molecules. In the  case of amino acids, once the nitrogen is removed from the amino  acid the remaining carbon skeleton can be enzymatically converted  into acetyl-CoA or some other intermediate of the citric acid cycle.  Acetyl-CoA, a two-carbon molecule common to glucose, lipid, and  protein metabolism enters the second stage of energy metabolism,  the citric acid cycle.  In the citric acid cycle, acetyl-CoA is joined to a four-carbon  molecule. In this multistep pathway, two carbons are lost as two  The Atom  |  465'},\n",

NADH and FADH2 carry the electrons to the inner  membrane in the mitochondria where the third stage of energy  release takes place, in what is called the electron transport chain. In  this metabolic pathway a sequential transfer of electrons between  multiple proteins occurs and ATP is synthesized. The entire process  of nutrient catabolism is chemically similar to burning, as carbon  and hydrogen atoms are\\xa0 combusted (oxidized) producing carbon  dioxide, water, and heat. However, the stepwise chemical reactions  in nutrient catabolism pathways slow the oxidation of carbon atoms  so that much of the energy is captured and not all transformed into  heat and light. Complete nutrient catabolism is between 30 and 40  percent efficient, and some of the energy is therefore released as  heat. Heat is a vital product of nutrient catabolism and is involved in  maintaining body temperature. If cells were too efficient at trapping  nutrient energy into ATP, humans would not last to the next meal, as  they would die of hypothermia (excessively low body temperature).  Anabolism: The Building  The energy released by catabolic pathways powers anabolic  pathways in the building of macromolecules such as the proteins  RNA and DNA, and even entire new cells and tissues. Anabolic  pathways are required to build new tissue, such as muscle, after  prolonged exercise or the remodeling of bone tissue, a process  involving both catabolic and anabolic pathways. Anabolic pathways  also build energy-storage molecules, such as Glycogen and  triglycerides.

For example, the citric-acid-cycle intermediate,  α-ketoglutarate can be anabolically processed to the amino acids  glutamate or glutamine if they are required. The human body is  capable of synthesizing eleven of the twenty amino acids that make  up proteins. The metabolic pathways of amino acid synthesis are  all inhibited by the specific amino acid that is the end-product of a  given pathway. Thus, if a cell has enough glutamine it turns off its  synthesis.  Anabolic pathways are regulated by their end-products, but even  more so by the energy state of the cell. When there is ample energy,  bigger molecules, such as protein, RNA and DNA, will be built as  needed. Alternatively, when energy is insufficient, proteins and  other molecules will be destroyed and catabolized to release energy.  A dramatic example of this is seen in children with marasmus, a  form of advanced starvation. These children have severely  compromised bodily functions, often culminating in death by  infection. Children with marasmus are starving for calories and  protein,  which  are  required  to  make  energy  and  build  macromolecules. The negative-energy balance in children who have  marasmus results in the breakdown of muscle tissue and tissues of  other organs in the body’s attempt to survive.

Glucose is stored mainly in  muscle and liver tissues. In these tissues it is stored as glycogen, a  highly branched macromolecule consisting of thousands of glucose  molecules held together by chemical bonds. The glucose molecules  are joined together by an anabolic pathway called glycogenesis.  For each molecule of glucose stored, one molecule of ATP is used.  Therefore, it costs energy to store energy. Glycogen levels do not  take long to reach their physiological limit and when this happens  excess glucose will be converted to fat. A cell in positive-energy  balance detects a high concentration of ATP as well as acetyl-CoA  produced by catabolic pathways. In response, the rate of catabolism  is slowed or shut off and the synthesis of fatty acids, which occurs  by an anabolic pathway called lipogenesis, is turned on. The newly  made fatty acids are transported to fat-storing cells called  adipocytes where they are stored as triglycerides. Fat is a better  alternative to glycogen for energy storage as it is more compact (per  unit of energy) and, unlike glycogen, the body does not store water  along with fat. Water weighs a significant amount, and increased  glycogen stores, which are accompanied by water, would  dramatically increase body weight.

A nutrient’s  metabolic path is dependent upon energy balance. When you are in  a positive energy balance the excess nutrient energy will be stored  or used to grow (e.g., during childhood, pregnancy, and wound  healing). When you are in negative energy balance you aren’t taking  in enough energy to meet your needs, so your body will need to use  its stores to provide energy. Energy balance is achieved when intake  of energy is equal to energy expended. Weight can be thought of as  a whole body estimate of energy balance; body weight is maintained  when the body is in energy balance, lost when it is in negative  energy balance, and gained when it is in positive energy balance.

Estimating Energy Requirement  To maintain body weight you have to balance the calories obtained  from food and beverages with the calories expended every day.  Here, we will discuss how to calculate your energy needs in  kilocalories per day so that you can determine whether your caloric  intake falls short, meets, or exceeds your energy needs. The  Institute of Medicine has devised a formula for calculating your  Estimated Energy Requirement (EER). It takes into account your  age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity level (PA). The EER is  a standardized mathematical prediction of a person’s daily energy  needs in kilocalories per day required to maintain weight. It is  calculated for those over 18 years of age via the following formulas:  Adult male: EER = 662 − [9.53 X age (y)] + PA X [15.91 X wt (kg) +  5.39.6 X ht (m)]  Adult female: EER = 354 − [6.91 x age (y)] + PA x [9.36 x wt (kg) +  726 x ht (m)]  Note: to convert pounds to kilograms, divide weight in pounds by  2.2.

Total Energy Expenditure (Output)  The amount of energy you expend every day includes not only the  calories you burn during physical activity, but also the calories you  burn while at rest (basal metabolism), and the calories you burn  when you digest food. The sum of caloric expenditure is referred  to as total energy expenditure (TEE). Basal metabolism refers to  those metabolic pathways necessary to support and maintain the  body’s basic functions (e.g. breathing, heartbeat, liver and kidney  function) while at rest. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount  of energy required by the body to conduct its basic functions over  a certain time period. The great majority of energy expended  (between 50 and 70 percent) daily is from conducting life’s basic  processes.

BMR is dependent on body size,  body composition, sex, age, nutritional status, and genetics. People  with a larger frame size have a higher BMR simply because they  have more mass. Muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue  even while at rest and thus the more muscle mass a person has, the  higher their BMR. Since females typically have less muscle mass and  a smaller frame size than men, their BMRs are generally lower than  men’s. As we get older muscle mass declines and thus so does BMR.  Nutritional status also affects basal metabolism. Caloric restriction,  as occurs while dieting, for example, causes a decline in BMR. This is  because the body attempts to maintain homeostasis and will adapt  by slowing down its basic functions to offset the decrease in energy  intake. Body temperature and thyroid hormone levels are additional  determinants of BMR.

Hunger pangs are real and so is a “growling” stomach. When the  stomach is empty it contracts, producing the characteristic pang  and “growl.” The stomach’s mechanical movements relay neural  signals to the hypothalamus, which relays other neural signals to  parts of the brain. This results in the conscious feeling of the need  to eat. Alternatively, after you eat a meal the stomach stretches and  sends a neural signal to the brain stimulating the sensation of satiety  and relaying the message to stop eating. The stomach also sends out  certain hormones when it is full and others when it is empty. These  hormones communicate to the hypothalamus and other areas of the  brain either to stop eating or to find some food.  Fat tissue also plays a role in regulating food intake. Fat tissue  produces the hormone leptin, which communicates to the satiety  center in the hypothalamus that the body is in positive energy  486  |  Factors Affecting Energy Intake'},\n",

The discovery of leptin’s functions sparked a craze in the  research world and the diet pill industry, as it was hypothesized that  if you give leptin to a person who is overweight, they will decrease  their food intake. Alas, this is not the case. In several clinical trials  it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually  resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as  well to it.1  Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese  person there is no sustained effect on food intake.  Nutrients themselves also play a role in influencing food intake.  The hypothalamus senses nutrient levels in the blood. When they  are low the hunger center is stimulated, and when they are high  the satiety center is stimulated. Furthermore, cravings for salty  and sweet foods have an underlying physiological basis. Both  undernutrition and overnutrition affect hormone levels and the  neural circuitry controlling appetite, which makes losing or gaining  weight a substantial physiological hurdle.

Tools for Change  Support the consumer movement of pushing the fast food industry  and your favorite local restaurants into serving more nutrient- dense foods. You can begin this task by starting simple, such as  requesting extra tomatoes and lettuce on your burger and more  nutrient-dense choices in the salad bar. Also, choose their low- calorie menu options and help support the emerging market of  healthier choices in the fast food industry. In today’s fast-paced  society, it is difficult for most people to avoid fast food all the time.  When you do need a quick bite on the run, choose the fast food  restaurants that serve healthier foods.

This brings up the importance of the interactions of  genes and the environment.  Not all individuals who take a weight-loss drug lose weight and  not all people who smoke are thin. An explanation for these  discrepancies is that each individual’s genes respond differently  to a specific environment. Alternatively, environmental factors can  influence a person’s gene profile, which is exemplified by the effects  of the prenatal environment on body weight and fatness and disease  incidence later in life.1  One example is a study of the offspring of women who were  overweight during pregnancy had a greater propensity for being  overweight  and  for  developing  Type  2  diabetes.

Of course, the sedentary  lifestyle of many North Americans contributes to their average  energy expenditure in daily life. Simply put, the more you sit, the  less energy you expend. A study published in a 2008 issue of the  American Journal of Epidemiology reports that 55 percent of  Americans spend 7.7 hours in sedentary behavior daily.2  Fortunately, including only a small amount of low-level physical  activity benefits weight control. A study published in the June 2001  issue of the International Journal of Behavioral Nutritionand  Physical Activity reports that even breaking up sitting-time with  frequent but brief increased energy expenditure activities, such as  walking for five minutes every hour, helps maintain weight and even  aids in weight loss.3  Americans partake in an excessive amount of screen time, which  is a sedentary behavior that not only reduces energy expenditure,  but also contributes to weight gain because of the exposure to  aggressive advertising campaigns for unhealthy foods.  2.\\xa0Matthews CE, Chen KY, et al.

Escalators, moving walkways, and elevators  (not to mention cars!) are common modes of transportation that  reduce average daily energy expenditure. Office work, high-stress  jobs, and occupations requiring extended working hours are all  societal pressures that reduce the time allotted for exercise of large  populations of Americans. Even the remote controls that many have  for various electronic devices in their homes contribute to the US  society being less active. More obesogenic factors were discussed in  the weight management section of this chapter.  Socioeconomic status has been found to be inversely proportional  to weight gain. One reason for this relationship is that inhabitants  of low-income neighborhoods have reduced access to safe streets  and parks for walking. Another is that fitness clubs are expensive  and few are found in lower-income neighborhoods. The recent and  long-lasting economic crisis in this country is predicted to have  profound effects on the average body weight of Americans. The  number of homeless in this country is rising with many children and  adults living in hotels and cars. As you can imagine neither of these  “home spaces” has a kitchen, making it impossible to cook nutritious  meals and resulting in increased economically-forced access to  cheap, unhealthy foods, such as that at a nearby gas station.

China, the most populous country in the world, now has more than  215 million people, approximately one-fifth of their population, that  are considered overweight or obese.4  The increase in China’s waistline is partly attributed to changes  in the traditional diet, more sedentary lives, and a massive increase  in motor vehicle use. Moreover, China’s recent famines in the 1950s,  which affected the poor and lower classes to a greater extent than  the upper class, have sanctioned lax social attitudes toward body  fat and reinspired the age-old Chinese belief that excess body fat  represents health and prosperity.  One of the worst statistics regarding overweight and obesity in  China is that more than ten million adolescents between ages  seventeen and eighteen were overweight in 2000, which is twenty- eight times the number that were overweight in 1985.5  The associated diseases of overweight and obesity happen over  many years, and signs and symptoms commonly take decades to  manifest. With China’s younger population and other developed  countries experiencing a dramatic weight increase, the associated  chronic diseases will come about much earlier in life than in  previous generations.

Doing one without the other  limits the amount of weight lost and the length of time that weight  loss is sustained.

The gradual  rise in overweight is happening because, on average, people  consume slightly more calories daily than they expend, resulting in  a gradual weight gain of one to two pounds a year. In 2003 the idea  was first published that promoting small lifestyle changes to reduce  weight gain occurring over time in all age groups may better reduce  obesity rates in the American population.10  Scientific studies have demonstrated that asking people to  increase the number of steps they take each day while providing  them with pedometers that count the steps they take each day  successfully prevented weight gain.

Vitamins  are absorbed primarily in the small intestine and their bioavailability  is dependent on the food composition of the diet. Fat-soluble  vitamins are absorbed along with dietary fat. Therefore, if a meal  is very low in fat, the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins will be  impaired. Once fat-soluble vitamins have been absorbed in the small  intestine, they are packaged and incorporated into chylomicrons  along with other fatty acids and transported in the lymphatic  system to the liver.

Retinol is the form of vitamin A found in animal-derived  foods, and is converted in the body to the biologically active forms  of vitamin A: retinal and retinoic acid (thus retinol is sometimes  referred to as “preformed vitamin A”). About 10 percent of plant- derived carotenoids, including beta-carotene, can be converted in  the body to retinoids and are another source of functional vitamin  A. Carotenoids are pigments synthesized by plants that give them  their yellow, orange, and red color. Over six hundred carotenoids  have been identified and, with just a few exceptions, all are found  in the plant kingdom. There are two classes of carotenoids—the  xanthophylls, which contain oxygen, and the carotenes, which do  not.  In plants, carotenoids absorb light for use in photosynthesis and  act as antioxidants. Beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta- cryptoxanthin are converted to some extent to retinol in the body.  The other carotenoids, such as lycopene, are not. Many biological  actions of carotenoids are attributed to their antioxidant activity,  but they likely act by other mechanisms, too.  Vitamin A is fat-soluble and is packaged into chylomicrons in  small intestine, and transported to the liver. The liver stores and  exports vitamin A as needed; it is released into the blood bound to a  retinol-binding protein, which transports it to cells. Carotenoids are  not absorbed as well as vitamin A, but similar to vitamin A, they do  require fat in the meal for absorption. In intestinal cells, carotenoids  Fat-Soluble Vitamins  |  521'},\n",

In the liver,  carotenoids are repackaged into lipoproteins, which transport them  to cells.  The retinoids are aptly named as their most notable function is  in the retina of the eye where they aid in vision, particularly in  seeing under low-light conditions. This is why night blindness is the  most definitive sign of vitamin A deficiency.Vitamin A has several  important functions in the body, including maintaining vision and a  healthy immune system. Many of vitamin A’s functions in the body  are similar to the functions of hormones (for example, vitamin A can  interact with DNA, causing a change in protein function). Vitamin A  assists in maintaining healthy skin and the linings and coverings of  tissues; it also regulates growth and development. As an antioxidant,  vitamin A protects cellular membranes, helps in maintaining  glutathione levels, and influences the amount and activity of  enzymes that detoxify free radicals.  Vision  Retinol that is circulating in the blood is taken up by cells in the  eye retina, where it is converted to retinal and is used to help  the pigment rhodopsin, which is involved in the eye’s ability to see  under low light conditions. A deficiency in vitamin A thus results in  less rhodopsin and a decrease in the detection of low-level light, a  condition referred to as night-blindness.  Insufficient intake of dietary vitamin A over time can also cause  complete vision loss. In fact, vitamin A deficiency is the number  one cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Vitamin A not only  supports the vision function of eyes but also maintains the  coverings and linings of the eyes. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to  the dysfunction of the linings and coverings of the eye (eg. bitot  spots),  causing  dryness  of  the  eyes,  a  condition  called  522  |  Fat-Soluble Vitamins'},\n",

In Asia in the late 1980s,  targeted populations of children were administered vitamin A  supplements, and the death rates from measles and diarrhea  declined by up to 50 percent. Vitamin A supplementation in these  deficient populations did not reduce the number of children who  contracted these diseases, but it did decrease the severity of the  diseases so that they were no longer fatal. Soon after the results  of these studies were communicated to the rest of the world, the  World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations  Children’s Fund (UNICEF) commenced worldwide campaigns  against vitamin A deficiency. UNICEF estimates that the distribution  of over half a billion vitamin A capsules prevents 350,000 childhood  deaths annually.1  In the twenty-first century, science has demonstrated that  vitamin A greatly affects the immune system. What we are still  lacking are clinical trials investigating the proper doses of vitamin  A required to help ward off infectious disease and how large of  an effect vitamin A supplementation has on populations that are  not deficient in this vitamin. This brings up one of our common  themes in this text—micronutrient deficiencies may contribute to  the development, progression, and severity of a disease, but this  does not mean that an increased intake of these micronutrients will  solely prevent or cure disease. The effect, as usual, is cumulative and  depends on the diet as a whole, among other things.  1.\\xa0Sommer A. (2008). Vitamin A Deficiency and Clinical  Disease: An Historical Overview.

This  is the primary way that vitamin A affects growth and development.  Vitamin A deficiency in children is linked to growth retardation;  however, vitamin A deficiency is often accompanied by protein  malnutrition and iron deficiency, thereby confounding the  investigation of vitamin A’s specific effects on growth and  development.  In the fetal stages of life, vitamin A is important for limb, heart,  eye, and ear development and in both deficiency and excess, vitamin  A causes birth defects. Furthermore, both males and females require  vitamin A in the diet to effectively reproduce.  Cancer  Vitamin A’s role in regulating cell growth and death, especially in  tissues that line and cover organs, suggests it may be effective in  treating certain cancers of the lung, neck, and liver. It has been  shown in some observational studies that vitamin A-deficient  populations have a higher risk for some cancers. However, vitamin  A supplements have actually been found to increase the risk of lung  cancer in people who are at high risk for the disease (i.e., smokers,  ex-smokers, workers exposed to asbestos).

There is  preformed vitamin A, which is abundant in many animal-derived  foods, and there are carotenoids, which are found in high  concentrations in vibrantly colored fruits and vegetables and some  oils.  Some carotenoids are converted to retinol in the body by  intestinal cells and liver cells. However, only minuscule amounts  of certain carotenoids are converted to retinol, meaning fruits and  vegetables are not necessarily good sources of vitamin A.  The RDA for vitamin A includes all sources of vitamin A. The  RDA for vitamin A is given in mcg of Retinol Activity Equivalent  (RAE) to take into account the many different forms it is available  in. \\xa0The human body converts all dietary sources of vitamin A into  retinol. Therefore, 1 mcg of retinol is equivalent to 12 mcg of beta- carotene, and 24 mcg of alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin. \\xa0For  example, 12 micrograms of fruit- or vegetable-based beta-carotene  will yield 1 microgram of retinol. Currently vitamin A listed in food  and on supplement labels use international units (IUs). The following  conversions are listed below3:  • 1 IU retinol = 0.3 mcg RAE  • 1 IU beta-carotene from dietary supplements = 0.15 mcg RAE  • 1 IU beta-carotene from food = 0.05 mcg RAE  • 1 IU alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin = 0.025 mcg RAE  3.\\xa0Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet: Vitamin A.

Vitamin D Functions and Health Benefits  Vitamin D refers to a group of fat-soluble vitamins derived from  cholesterol. Vitamins D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (calcitriol) are the  only ones known to have biological actions in the human body.  The skin synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. In fact,  for most people, more than 90 percent of their vitamin D3 comes  from the casual exposure to the UVB rays in sunlight. Anything  that reduces your exposure to the sun’s UVB rays decreases the  amount of vitamin D3 your skin synthesizes. That would include  long winters, your home’s altitude, whether you are wearing  sunscreen, and the color of your skin (including tanned skin). Do you  ever wonder about an increased risk for skin cancer by spending too  much time in the sun? Do not fret. Less than thirty minutes of sun  exposure to the arms and legs will increase blood levels of vitamin  D3 more than orally taking 10,000 IU (250 micrograms) of vitamin  D3.

In the absence of an adequate  intake of vitamin D, less than 15 percent of calcium is absorbed  from foods or supplements. The effects of calcitriol on calcium  homeostasis are critical for bone health. A deficiency of vitamin  D in children causes the bone disease nutritional rickets. Rickets  is very common among children in developing countries and is  characterized by soft, weak, deformed bones that are exceptionally  susceptible to fracture. In adults, vitamin D deficiency causes a  similar disease called osteomalacia, which is characterized by low  BMD. Osteomalacia has the same symptoms and consequences as  osteoporosis and often coexists with osteoporosis. Vitamin D  deficiency is common, especially in the elderly population, dark- skinned populations, and in the many people who live in the  northern latitudes where sunlight exposure is much decreased  during the long winter season.

According  to the IOM, the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for vitamin D is  4,000 international units per day.

Alpha-tocopherol and vitamin E’s other  constituents  are  fat-soluble  and  primarily  responsible  for  protecting cell membranes against lipid destruction caused by free  radicals, therefore making it an antioxidant. When alpha-tocopherol  interacts with a free radical it is no longer capable of acting as an  antioxidant unless it is enzymatically regenerated. Vitamin C helps  to regenerate some of the alpha-tocopherol, but the remainder is  eliminated from the body.

Vitamin K is critical for blood function acting  as coenzymes which play an essential role in blood coagulation (aka  blood clotting). Blood-clotting proteins are continuously circulating  in the blood. Upon injury to a blood vessel, platelets stick to the  wound forming a plug. Without vitamin K, blood would not clot.  A deficiency in vitamin K causes bleeding disorders. It is relatively  rare, but people who have liver or pancreatic disease, celiac disease,  or malabsorption conditions are at higher risk for vitamin K  deficiency.

It acts as  a cofactor for enzymes that break down glucose for energy  production (Figure 9.7 “Enzyme Active Site for Cofactors” ). Thiamin  plays a key role in nerve cells as the glucose that is catabolized by  thiamin is needed for an energy source. Additionally, thiamin plays a  role in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and is therefore required  for RNA, DNA, and ATP synthesis.  The brain and heart are most affected by a deficiency in thiamin.  Thiamin deficiency, also known as beriberi, can cause symptoms  of fatigue, confusion, movement impairment, pain in the lower  extremities, swelling, and heart failure. It is prevalent in societies  whose main dietary staple is white rice. During the processing of  white rice, the bran is removed, along with what were called in  the early nineteenth century, “accessory factors,” that are vital for  metabolism. Dutch physician Dr. Christiaan Eijkman cured chickens  of beriberi by feeding them unpolished rice bran in 1897. By 1912, Sir  Frederick Gowland Hopkins determined from his experiments with  animals that the “accessory factors,” eventually renamed vitamins,  are needed in the diet to support growth, since animals fed a diet  of pure carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and minerals failed to  grow.4Eijkman and Hopkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in  Physiology (or Medicine) in 1929 for their discoveries in the  emerging science of nutrition.

Niacin (B3)  Niacin is a component of the coenzymes NADH and NADPH, which  are involved in the catabolism and/or anabolism of carbohydrates,  lipids, and proteins. NADH is the predominant electron carrier and  transfers electrons to the electron-transport chain to make ATP.  NADPH is also required for the anabolic pathways of fatty-acid  and cholesterol synthesis. In contrast to other vitamins, niacin can  be synthesized by humans from the amino acid tryptophan in an  anabolic process requiring enzymes dependent on riboflavin,  vitamin B6, and iron. Niacin is made from tryptophan only after  tryptophan has met all of its other needs in the body. The  contribution of tryptophan-derived niacin to niacin needs in the  body varies widely and a few scientific studies have demonstrated  that diets high in tryptophan have very little effect on niacin  deficiency. Niacin deficiency is commonly known as pellagra and  the symptoms include fatigue, decreased appetite, and indigestion.  \\xa0These symptoms are then commonly followed by the four D’s:  diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and sometimes death.

Macrocytic  anemia is characterized by larger and fewer red blood cells.

Its  symptoms were severe and included diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia,  and even death.

Based on the antioxidant-supplement  industry’s success, the general public appears to believe these  health claims. However, these claims are not backed by scientific  evidence; rather, there is some evidence suggesting supplements  can actually cause harm. While scientists have found evidence  supporting the consumption of antioxidant-rich foods as a method  of reducing the risk of chronic disease, there is no “miracle cure”;  no pill or supplement alone can provide the same benefits as a  healthy diet. Remember, it is the combination of antioxidants and  other nutrients in healthy foods that is beneficial. In this section, we  will review how particular antioxidants function in the body, learn  how they work together to protect the body against free radicals,  and explore the best nutrient-rich dietary sources of antioxidants.

For  example, the immune system uses the cell-damaging properties of  free radicals to kill pathogens. First, immune cells engulf an invader  (such as a bacterium), then they expose it to free radicals such as  hydrogen peroxide, which destroys its membrane. The invader is  thus neutralized. Scientific studies also suggest hydrogen peroxide  acts as a signaling molecule that calls immune cells to injury sites,  meaning free radicals may aid with tissue repair when you get cut.  Free radicals are necessary for many other bodily functions as  well. The thyroid gland synthesizes its own hydrogen peroxide,  which is required for the production of thyroid hormone. Reactive  oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, which are free  radicals containing nitrogen, have been found to interact with  proteins in cells to produce signaling molecules. The free radical  nitric oxide has been found to help dilate blood vessels and act as a  chemical messenger in the brain. By acting as signaling molecules,  free radicals are involved in the control of their own synthesis,  stress responses, regulation of cell growth and death, and  metabolism.  Sources of Free Radicals in the  Environment  Substances and energy sources from the environment can add to or  accelerate the production of free radicals within the body.

They do so by being free radicals  themselves or by adding energy that provokes electrons to move  between atoms. Excessive exposure to environmental sources of  free radicals can contribute to disease by overwhelming the free  radical detoxifying systems and those processes involved in  repairing oxidative damage.  Oxidative Stress  Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance in any cell, tissue, or organ  between the amount of free radicals and the capabilities of the  detoxifying and repair systems. Sustained oxidative damage results  only under conditions of oxidative stress—when the detoxifying and  repair systems are insufficient. Free radical-induced damage, when  left unrepaired, destroys lipids, proteins, RNA, and DNA, and can  contribute to disease. Oxidative stress has been implicated as a  contributing factor to cancer, atherosclerosis (hardening of  arteries), arthritis, diabetes, kidney disease, Alzheimer’s disease,  Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, emphysema,  and cataracts.  Aging is a process that is genetically determined but modulated  by factors in the environment. In the process of aging, tissue  function declines. The idea that oxidative stress is the primary  contributor to age-related tissue decline has been around for  decades, and it is true that tissues accumulate free radical-induced  damage as we age. Recent scientific evidence slightly modifies this  theory by suggesting oxidative stress is not the initial trigger for  age-related decline of tissues; it is suggested that the true culprit  is progressive dysfunction of metabolic processes, which leads to  increases in free radical production, thus influencing the stress  response of tissues as they age.  598  |  The Body’s Offense'},\n",

Carotenoids are one type of phytochemical.  Phytochemicals also include indoles, lignans, phytoestrogens,  stanols,  saponins,  terpenes,  flavonoids,  carotenoids,  anthocyanidins, phenolic acids, and many more. They are found not  only in fruits and vegetables, but also in grains, seeds, nuts, and  legumes.  Many phytochemicals act as antioxidants, but they have several  other functions, such as mimicking hormones, altering absorption  of cholesterol, inhibiting inflammatory responses, and blocking the  actions of certain enzymes.  Phytochemicals are present in small amounts in the food supply,  and although thousands have been and are currently being  scientifically studied, their health benefits remain largely unknown.  Also largely unknown is their potential for toxicity, which could be  substantial if taken in large amounts in the form of supplements.  Moreover, phytochemicals often act in conjunction with each other  and with micronutrients. Thus, supplementing with only a few may  impair the functions of other phytochemicals or micronutrients.  As with the antioxidant vitamins, it is the mixture and variety of  phytochemicals in foods that are linked to health benefits.  \\xa0 Table 9.33 Some Phytochemical’s Obtained from Diet and Their  Related Functions  600  |  Phytochemicals'},\n",

There are 20 essential minerals that must be consumed  in our diets to remain healthy. \\xa0The amount of each mineral found in  our bodies vary greatly and therefore, so does consumption of those  minerals. When there is a deficiency in an essential mineral, health  problems may arise.  Major minerals are classified as minerals that are required in the  diet each day in amounts larger than 100 milligrams. These include  sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and  sulfur. These major minerals can be found in various foods. For  example, in Guam, the major mineral, calcium, is consumed in the  diet not only through dairy, a common source of calcium, but also  through through the mixed dishes, desserts and vegetables that  they consume. Consuming a varied diet significantly improves an  individual’s ability to meet their nutrient needs. \\xa01  Figure 10.1 The Major Minerals  1.\\xa0Pobocik RS, Trager A, Monson LM. (2008).

Although only 1 percent of  the calcium in the human body is found in the blood and soft tissues,  it is here that it performs the most critical functions. Blood calcium  levels are rigorously controlled so that if blood levels drop the body  will rapidly respond by stimulating bone resorption, thereby  releasing stored calcium into the blood. \\xa0Thus, bone tissue sacrifices  its stored calcium to maintain blood calcium levels. This is why bone  health is dependent on the intake of dietary calcium and also why  blood levels of calcium do not always correspond to dietary intake.  Calcium plays a role in a number of different functions in the  body like bone and tooth formation. The most well-known calcium  function is to build and strengthen bones and teeth. Recall that  when bone tissue first forms during the modeling or remodeling  process, it is unhardened, protein-rich osteoid tissue. In the  osteoblast-directed process of bone mineralization, calcium  phosphates (salts) are deposited on the protein matrix. The calcium  salts typically make up about 65 percent of bone tissue. When your  diet is calcium deficient, the mineral content of bone decreases  causing it to become brittle and weak. Thus, increased calcium  intake helps to increase the mineralized content of bone tissue.  Greater mineralized bone tissue corresponds to a greater BMD,  and to greater bone strength. The remaining calcium plays a role  in nerve impulse transmission by facilitating electrical impulse  transmission from one nerve cell to another. Calcium in muscle cells  Calcium  |  613'},\n",

Calcium is also essential in blood clotting by activating clotting  factors to fix damaged tissue.  In addition to calcium’s four primary functions calcium has  several other minor functions that are also critical for maintaining  normal physiology. For example, without calcium, the hormone  insulin could not be released from cells in the pancreas and  glycogen could not be broken down in muscle cells and used to  provide energy for muscle contraction.  Maintaining Calcium Levels  Because calcium performs such vital functions in the body, blood  calcium level is closely regulated by the hormones parathyroid  hormone (PTH), calcitriol, and calcitonin. When blood calcium levels  are low, PTH is secreted to increase blood calcium levels via three  different mechanisms. First, PTH stimulates the release of calcium  stored in the bone. Second, PTH acts on kidney cells to increase  calcium reabsorption and decrease its excretion in the urine. Third,  PTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that activate vitamin D to  calcitriol. \\xa0Calcitriol is the active hormone that acts on the intestinal  cells and increases dietary calcium absorption. When blood calcium  levels become too high, the hormone calcitonin is secreted by  certain cells in the thyroid gland and PTH secretion stops.\\xa0 At higher  nonphysiological concentrations, calcitonin lowers blood calcium  levels by increasing calcium excretion in the urine, preventing  further absorption of calcium in the gut and by directly inhibiting  bone resorption.

Another health benefit of a high-calcium diet is  that it blocks kidney stone formation. Calcium inhibits the  absorption of oxalate, a chemical in plants such as parsley and  spinach, which is associated with an increased risk for  developing kidney stones.

This was  found to be the case in supplements derived from oyster shell and  refined calcium carbonate. The same study also found that brands  claiming to be lead-free did, in fact, show very low lead levels.  Because lead levels in supplements are not disclosed on labels, it  is important to know that products not derived from oyster shell  or other natural substances are generally low in lead content.

This is partly attributed to the fact  that dietary sources of calcium supply additional nutrients with  health-promoting activities. It is reported that chelated forms of  calcium supplements are easier to absorb as the chelation process  protects the calcium from oxalates and phytates that may bind with  the calcium in the intestines. However, these are more expensive  supplements and only increase calcium absorption up to 10 percent.  In people with low dietary intakes of calcium, calcium supplements  have a negligible benefit on bone health in the absence of a vitamin  D supplement. However, when calcium supplements are taken along  with vitamin D, there are many benefits to bone health: peak bone  mass is increased in early adulthood, BMD is maintained throughout  adulthood, the risk of developing osteoporosis is reduced, and the  incidence of fractures is decreased in those who already had  osteoporosis. Calcium and vitamin D pills do not have to be taken at  the same time for effectiveness. But remember that vitamin D has to  be activated and in the bloodstream to promote calcium absorption.

While this is one study, several other large studies  have not shown that calcium supplementation increases the risk for  cardiovascular disease. While the debate over this continues in the  realm of science, we should focus on the things we do know:  1. There is overwhelming evidence that diets sufficient in  calcium prevent osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease.  2. People with risk factors for osteoporosis are advised to take  calcium supplements if they are unable to get enough calcium  in their diet. The National Osteoporosis Foundation advises  that adults age fifty and above consume 1,200 milligrams of  calcium per day. This includes calcium both from dietary  sources and supplements.  3. Consuming more calcium than is recommended is not better  for your health and can prove to be detrimental. Consuming  too much calcium at any one time, be it from diet or  supplements, impairs not only the absorption of calcium itself,  but also the absorption of other essential minerals, such as  iron and zinc.

Dietary Reference Intake for Calcium  The recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for calcium are listed  in Table 10.1 “Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium”. The RDA is  elevated to 1,300 milligrams per day during adolescence because  this is the life stage with accelerated bone growth. Studies have  shown that a higher intake of calcium during puberty increases  the total amount of bone tissue that accumulates in a person. For  women above age fifty and men older than seventy-one, the RDAs  are also a bit higher for several reasons including that as we age,  calcium absorption in the gut decreases, vitamin D3 activation is  reduced, and maintaining adequate blood levels of calcium is  important to prevent an acceleration of bone tissue loss (especially  during menopause). Currently, the dietary intake of calcium for  females above age nine is, on average, below the RDA for calcium.  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends that people do not  consume over 2,500 milligrams per day of calcium as it may cause  adverse effects in some people.

Tofu (made with calcium sulfate), turnip greens,  mustard greens, and chinese cabbage are good sources. For  a list of non-dairy sources you can find the calcium content  for thousands of foods by visiting the USDA National  Nutrient Database (http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/ foodcomp/search/).

With careful planning and good selections, you  can ensure that you are getting enough calcium in your diet  even if you do not drink milk or consume other dairy  products.  Calcium Bioavailability  In the small intestine, calcium absorption primarily takes place in  the duodenum (first section of the small intestine) when intakes  are low, but calcium is also absorbed passively in the jejunum and  ileum (second and third sections of the small intestine), especially  when intakes are higher.

The greatest positive influence on calcium absorption comes  from having an adequate intake of vitamin D. People deficient in  vitamin D absorb less than 15 percent of calcium from the foods they  eat. The hormone estrogen is another factor that enhances calcium  bioavailability. Thus, as a woman ages and goes through menopause,  during which estrogen levels fall, the amount of calcium absorbed  decreases and the risk for bone disease increases. Some fibers, such  as inulin, found in jicama, onions, and garlic, also promote calcium  intestinal uptake.  Chemicals that bind to calcium decrease its bioavailability. These  negative effectors of calcium absorption include the oxalates in  certain plants, the tannins in tea, phytates in nuts, seeds, and grains,  and some fibers. Oxalates are found in high concentrations in  spinach, parsley, cocoa, and beets. In general, the calcium  bioavailability is inversely correlated to the oxalate content in foods.  High-fiber, low-fat diets also decrease the amount of calcium  absorbed, an effect likely related to how fiber and fat influence  the amount of time food stays in the gut. Anything that causes  diarrhea, including sickness, medications, and certain symptoms  related to old age, decreases the transit time of calcium in the  gut and therefore decreases calcium absorption. As we get older,  stomach acidity sometimes decreases, diarrhea occurs more often,  kidney function is impaired, and vitamin D absorption and activation  is compromised, all of which contribute to a decrease in calcium  bioavailability.  \\xa0 Table 10.2 Calcium Content and Bioavailability of Various Foods  Calcium  |  627'},\n",

Magnesium is not an integral part of the hard mineral  crystals, but it does reside on the surface of the crystal and helps  maximize bone structure. Observational studies link magnesium  deficiency with an increased risk for osteoporosis. A magnesium- deficient diet is associated with decreased levels of parathyroid  hormone and the activation of vitamin D, which may lead to an  impairment of bone remodeling. A study in nine hundred elderly  women and men did show that higher dietary intakes of magnesium  correlated to an increased BMD in the hip.1 Only a few clinical  trials have evaluated the effects of magnesium supplements on bone  health and their results suggest some modest benefits on BMD.  In addition to participating in bone maintenance, magnesium has  several other functions in the body.

Magnesium  plays a role in the synthesis of DNA and RNA, carbohydrates, and  lipids, and is essential for nerve conduction and muscle contraction.  Another health benefit of magnesium is that it may decrease blood  pressure.  Many Americans do not get the recommended intake of  magnesium from their diets. Some observational studies suggest  mild magnesium deficiency is linked to increased risk for  cardiovascular disease. Signs and symptoms of severe magnesium  deficiency may include tremor, muscle spasms, loss of appetite, and  nausea.  Dietary Reference Intakes for Magnesium  The RDAs for magnesium for adults between ages nineteen and  thirty are 400 milligrams per day for males and 310 milligrams per  day for females.

Dietary Sources of Magnesium  Magnesium is part of the green pigment, chlorophyll, which is vital  for photosynthesis in plants; therefore green leafy vegetables are  a good dietary source for magnesium. Magnesium is also found in  high concentrations in fish, dairy products, meats, whole grains, and  nuts. Additionally chocolate, coffee, and hard water contain a good  amount of magnesium. Most people in America do not fulfill the RDA  for magnesium in their diets. Typically, Western diets lean toward  a low fish intake and the unbalanced consumption of refined grains  versus whole grains.  Table 10.7 Magnesium Content of Various Foods  642  |  Magnesium'},\n",

Iodine deficiency is a major  concern in countries around the world such as Fiji. \\xa0In the 1990’s,  almost 50% of the population had signs of iodine deficiency also  known as goiter. To combat this national issue, the government  of Fiji banned non-iodized salt and allowed only fortified iodized  salt into the country in hopes of increasing the consumption of  iodine in people’s diets. \\xa0With this law, and health promotion efforts  encouraging the consumption of seafood, great progress has been  made in decreasing the prevalence of iodine deficiency in Fiji.1  Figure 11.1 The Trace Minerals  1.\\xa0Micronutrient Deficiencies.

It  is composed of four globular peptides, each containing a heme  complex. In the center of each heme, lies iron (Figure 11.2). Iron is  needed for the production of other iron-containing proteins such as  myoglobin. \\xa0Myoglobin is a protein found in the muscle tissues that  enhances the amount of available oxygen for muscle contraction.  Iron is also a key component of hundreds of metabolic enzymes.  Many of the proteins of the electron-transport chain contain  iron–sulfur clusters involved in the transfer of high-energy  electrons and ultimately ATP synthesis. Iron is also involved in  numerous metabolic reactions that take place mainly in the liver  and detoxify harmful substances. Moreover, iron is required for  DNA synthesis. The great majority of iron used in the body is that  recycled from the continuous breakdown of red blood cells.  Figure 11.2 The Structure of Hemoglobin  Iron  |  655'},\n",
